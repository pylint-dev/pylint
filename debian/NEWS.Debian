pylint (0.13.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * pylint.el is no longer installed for emacs, because it is not
    compatible with emacs22 and has a large number of related bugs. It
    will be reenabled in a future version, when all the bugs have been
    dealt with by upstream (patches are welcome by the way).  Emacs21
    users may get it from /usr/share/doc/pylint/examples/pylint.el
