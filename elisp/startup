;; The %PACKAGE% package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'Emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; We have to add this to the load-path:
(setq load-path (cons (concat "/usr/share/"
                              (symbol-name debian-emacs-flavor)
                              "/site-lisp/%PACKAGE%") load-path))
(load-library "pylint")
