Removed Changes
===============

* ``pylint-gui`` was removed, because it was deemed unfit for being included
  in *pylint*. It had a couple of bugs and misfeatures, its usability was subpar
  and since its development was neglected, we decided it is best to move on without it.


* The HTML reporter was removed, including the ``--output-format=html`` option.
  It was lately a second class citizen in Pylint, being mostly neglected.
  Since we now have the JSON reporter, it can be used as a basis for building
  more prettier HTML reports than what Pylint can currently generate. This is
  part of the effort of removing cruft from Pylint, by removing less used
  features.

* The ``--files-output`` option was removed. While the same functionality cannot
  be easily replicated, the JSON reporter, for instance, can be used as a basis
  for generating the messages per each file.

* ``--required-attributes`` option was removed.

* ``--ignore-iface-methods`` option was removed.

* The ``--optimize-ast`` flag was removed.

  The option was initially added for handling pathological cases,
  such as joining too many strings using the addition operator, which
  was leading pylint to have a recursion error when trying to figure
  out what the string was. Unfortunately, we decided to ignore the
  issue, since the pathological case would have happen when the
  code was parsed by Python as well, without actually reaching the
  runtime step and as such, we decided to remove the error altogether.
