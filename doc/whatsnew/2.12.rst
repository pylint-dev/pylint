 What's New in Pylint 2.12
***************************

:Release: 2.12
:Date: TBA

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Added ``missing-any-param-doc`` triggered when a function has neither parameter nor parameter type
 documentation. Undocumented parameters are now being properly identified. A warning might start to
 appear unexpectedly if ``missing-param-doc`` and ``missing-type-doc`` were disabled, as a new message
 ``missing-any-param-doc`` will be emitted instead.

  Closes #3799

* Checkers for ``typing.final``

  * Added ``overridden-final-method``: Emitted when a method which is annotated with ``typing.final`` is overridden

  * Added ``subclassed-final-class``: Emitted when a class which is annotated with ``typing.final`` is subclassed

  Closes #3197


Removed checkers

Extensions
==========


Other Changes
=============

* Improve and flatten ``unused-wildcard-import`` message

  Closes #3859

* In length checker, ``len-as-condition`` has been renamed as
  ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-len`` in order to be consistent with
  ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison``.
