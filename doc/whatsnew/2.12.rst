***************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.12
***************************

:Release: 2.12
:Date: TBA

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Added ``missing-any-param-doc`` triggered when a function has neither parameter nor parameter type
  documentation. Undocumented parameters are now being properly identified. A warning might start to
  appear unexpectedly if ``missing-param-doc`` and ``missing-type-doc`` were disabled, as a new message
  ``missing-any-param-doc`` will be emitted instead.

  Closes #3799

* Checkers for ``typing.final``

  * Added ``overridden-final-method``: Emitted when a method which is annotated with ``typing.final`` is overridden

  * Added ``subclassed-final-class``: Emitted when a class which is annotated with ``typing.final`` is subclassed

  Closes #3197

* Created new ``UnsupportedVersionChecker`` checker class that includes checks for features
  not supported by all versions indicated by a ``py-version``.

  * Added ``using-f-string-in-unsupported-version`` checker. Issued when ``py-version``
    is set to a version that does not support f-strings (< 3.6)


Removed checkers
================


Extensions
==========


Other Changes
=============

* Improve and flatten ``unused-wildcard-import`` message

  Closes #3859

* In length checker, ``len-as-condition`` has been renamed as
  ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-len`` in order to be consistent with
  ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison``.

* ``undefined-variable`` now correctly flags variables which only receive a type annotations
  and never get assigned a value

  Closes #5140
