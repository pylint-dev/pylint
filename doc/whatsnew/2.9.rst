Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

Other Changes
=============

* Pylint's tags are now the standard form ``vX.Y.Z`` and not ``pylint-X.Y.Z`` anymore.

* Fix false-positive ``too-many-ancestors`` when inheriting from builtin classes,
  especially from the ``collections.abc`` module

* The output messages for ``arguments-differ`` error message have been customized based on the different error cases.

* New option ``--fail-on=<msg ids>`` to return non-zero exit codes regardless of ``fail-under`` value.

* A new error called ``arguments-renamed`` has been created, which identifies any changes at the parameter names
  of overridden functions. It aims to separate the functionality of ``arguments-differ``.
