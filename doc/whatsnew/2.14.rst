***************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.14
***************************

:Release: 2.14
:Date: TBA

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Added new checker ``typevar-name-mismatch``: TypeVar must be assigned to a variable with the same name as its name argument.

  Closes #5224

* ``invalid-enum-extension``: Used when a class tries to extend an inherited Enum class.

  Closes #5501

* Added new checker ``typevar-double-variance``: The "covariant" and "contravariant" keyword arguments
  cannot both be set to "True" in a TypeVar.

  Closes #5895

* Add new check ``unnecessary-dunder-call`` for unnecessary dunder method calls.

  Closes #5936

* ``potential-index-error``: Emitted when the index of a list or tuple exceeds its length.
  This checker is currently quite conservative to avoid false positives. We welcome
  suggestions for improvements.

  Closes #578

* Added new checker ``unnecessary-list-index-lookup`` for indexing into a list while
  iterating over ``enumerate()``.

  Closes #4525

* Added new message called ``duplicate-value`` which identifies duplicate values inside sets.

  Closes #5880

  to access the global configuration object instead of a checker-specific object.

  Ref #5392

* The ``level`` attribute of ``BaseChecker`` has been deprecated: everything is now
  displayed in ``--help``, all the time.

  ``checker.linter.config``.

  Ref #5392

  private API and most methods that were public on ``OptionsManagerMixIn`` have now been deprecated and will
  be removed in a future release.

  Ref #5392

* ``OptionsProviderMixIn`` has been replaced with ``ArgumentsProvider``. ``ArgumentsProvider`` is considered
  private API and most methods that were public on ``OptionsProviderMixIn`` have now been deprecated and will

  Ref #5462

  includes an unknown message.

* The concept of checker priority has been removed.

* ``BaseChecker`` classes now require the ``linter`` argument to be passed.

* The ``set_config_directly`` decorator has been removed.

* The ``ignore-mixin-members`` option has been deprecated. You should now use the new
  ``ignored-checks-for-mixins`` option.
