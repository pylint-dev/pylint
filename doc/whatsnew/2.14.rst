:Release: 2.14
:Date: TBA

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Added new checker ``typevar-name-mismatch``: TypeVar must be assigned to a variable with the same name as its name argument.

  Closes #5224

* ``invalid-enum-extension``: Used when a class tries to extend an inherited Enum class.

  Closes #5501

* Added new checker ``typevar-double-variance``: The "covariant" and "contravariant" keyword arguments
  cannot both be set to "True" in a TypeVar.

  Closes #5895

* Add new check ``unnecessary-dunder-call`` for unnecessary dunder method calls.

  Closes #5936

* ``potential-index-error``: Emitted when the index of a list or tuple exceeds its length.
  This checker is currently quite conservative to avoid false positives. We welcome
  suggestions for improvements.

  Closes #578

* Added new checker ``unnecessary-list-index-lookup`` for indexing into a list while
  iterating over ``enumerate()``.

  Closes #4525

* Added new message called ``duplicate-value`` which identifies duplicate values inside sets.

  Closes #5880

    * Re-enable checker ``bad-docstring-quotes`` for Python <= 3.7.

Other Changes
=============

* Update ``invalid-slots-object`` message to show bad object rather than its inferred value.

  Closes #6101

* Removed the broken ``generate-man`` option.

  Closes #5283
  Closes #1887

* Fix false negative for ``bad-string-format-type`` if the value to be formatted is passed in
  as a variable holding a constant.

* The concept of checker priority has been removed.

* The ``set_config_directly`` decorator has been removed.

* The ``ignore-mixin-members`` option has been deprecated. You should now use the new
  ``ignored-checks-for-mixins`` option.

  Closes #5205

  attribute to itself without any prior assignment.
