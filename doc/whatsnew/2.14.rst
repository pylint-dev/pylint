Summary -- Release highlights

New checkers
============

* ``potential-index-error``: Emitted when the index of a list or tuple exceeds its length.
  This checker is currently quite conservative to avoid false positives. We welcome
  suggestions for improvements.

  Closes #578

* Added new checker ``unnecessary-list-index-lookup`` for indexing into a list while
  iterating over ``enumerate()``.

  Closes #4525

* Fix false negative for ``no-member`` when attempting to assign an instance
  attribute to itself without any prior assignment.

  Closes #1555
