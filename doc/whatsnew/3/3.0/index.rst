Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

Pylint now provides some important usability and performance improvements,
along with enacting necessary breaking changes and long-announced deprecations.

There's going to be frequent beta releases,
before the official releases, everyone is welcome to try the betas
so we find problems before the actual release.

The required ``astroid`` version is now 3.0.0. See the
`astroid changelog <https://pylint.readthedocs.io/projects/astroid/en/latest/changelog.html#what-s-new-in-astroid-3-0-0>`_
for additional fixes, features, and performance improvements applicable to pylint.
