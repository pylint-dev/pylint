**************************
  What's New In Pylint 1.1
**************************

Release date: 2013-12-22

* Add new check for use of deprecated pragma directives "pylint:disable-msg"
  or "pylint:enable-msg" (I0022, deprecated-pragma) which was previously
  emitted as a regular warn().

* Avoid false used-before-assignment for except handler defined
  identifier used on the same line (#111).

* Combine 'no-space-after-operator', 'no-space-after-comma' and
  'no-space-before-operator' into a new warning 'bad-whitespace'.

* Add a new warning 'superfluous-parens' for unnecessary
  parentheses after certain keywords.

* Fix a potential crash in the redefine-in-handler warning
  if the redefined name is a nested getattr node.

* Add a new option for the multi-statement warning to
  allow single-line if statements.

* Add 'bad-context-manager' error, checking that '__exit__'
  special method accepts the right number of arguments.

* Run pylint as a python module 'python -m pylint' (anatoly techtonik).

* Check for non-exception classes inside an except clause.

* epylint support options to give to pylint after the file to analyze and
  have basic input validation (bitbucket #53 and #54), patches provided by
  felipeochoa and Brian Lane.

* Added a new warning, 'non-iterator-returned', for non-iterators
  returned by '__iter__'.

* Add new checks for unpacking non-sequences in assignments
  (unpacking-non-sequence) as well as unbalanced tuple unpacking
  (unbalanced-tuple-unpacking).

* useless-else-on-loop not emitted if there is a break in the
  else clause of inner loop (#117).

* don't mark ``input`` as a bad function when using python3 (#110).

* badly-implemented-container caused several problems in its
  current implementation. Deactivate it until we have something
  better. See #112 for instance.

* Use attribute regexp for properties in python3, as in python2

* Create the PYLINTHOME directory when needed, it might fail and lead to
  spurious warnings on import of pylint.config.

* Fix setup.py so that pylint properly install on Windows when using python3

* Various documentation fixes and enhancements

* Fix issue #55 (false-positive trailing-whitespace on Windows)
