**************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.5
**************************

:Release: 2.5
:Date: TBC


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* A new check ``f-string-without-interpolation`` was added.

  This check is emitted whenever **pylint** detects the use of an
  f-string without having any interpolated values in it, which means
  that the f-string can be a normal string.


Other Changes
=============

* Configuration can be read from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file
  in the current directory.
  A setup.cfg must prepend pylintrc section names with ``pylint.``,
  for example ``[pylint.MESSAGES CONTROL]``.
  A pyproject.toml file must prepend section names with ``tool.pylint.``,
  for example ``[tool.pylint.'MESSAGES CONTROL']``.
  These files can also be passed in on the command line.

* Mutable ``collections.*`` are now flagged as dangerous defaults.
