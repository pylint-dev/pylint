Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

In pylint 2.15.0, we added a new check ``missing-timeout`` to warn of
default timeout values that could cause a program to be hanging indefinitely.

>e improved ``pylint``'s handling of namespace packages. More packages should
be linted without resorting to using the ``-recursive=y`` option.
