Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

In pylint 2.15.0, we added a new check ``missing-timeout`` to warn of
default timeout values that could cause a program to be hanging indefinitely.

We improved ``pylint``'s handling of namespace packages. More packages should
be linted without resorting to using the ``--recursive=y`` option.

We still welcome any community effort to help review, integrate, and add good/bad examples to the doc for
<https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5953>`_. This should be doable without any ``pylint`` or ``astroid``
knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to ``pylint`` or open source without
any experience with our code!

Internally, we changed the way we generate the release notes, thanks to DudeNr33.
There will be no more conflict resolution to do in the changelog, and every contributor rejoice.

Marc Byrne became a maintainer, welcome to the team !

  change, it would silently fail to register the plugin for use, but would load

- Fix ignored files being linted when passed on stdin.

  Closes #4354 (`#4354 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4354>`_)

  the ``no-docstring-rgx`` option.
