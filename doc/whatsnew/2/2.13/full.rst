  Refs #5987


What's New in Pylint 2.13.1?
----------------------------
Release date: 2022-03-26

* Fix a regression in 2.13.0 where ``used-before-assignment`` was emitted for
  the usage of a nonlocal in a try block.

  Closes #5965

* Avoid emitting ``raising-bad-type`` when there is inference ambiguity on

* Loosen TypeVar default name pattern a bit to allow names with multiple uppercase
  characters. E.g. ``HVACModeT`` or ``IPAddressT``.

  Closes #5981

* Fixed false positive for ``unused-argument`` when a ``nonlocal`` name is used
  in a nested function that is returned without being called by its parent.

  Closes #5187

* Fix program crash for ``modified_iterating-list/set/dict`` when the list/dict/set
  being iterated through is a function call.

  Closes #5969

* Don't emit ``broken-noreturn`` and ``broken-collections-callable`` errors
  inside ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` blocks.


What's New in Pylint 2.13.0?
----------------------------
Release date: 2022-03-24

* Add missing dunder methods to ``unexpected-special-method-signature`` check.

* No longer emit ``no-member`` in for loops that reference ``self`` if the binary operation that
  started the for loop uses a ``self`` that is encapsulated in tuples or lists.

  Refs PyCQA/astroid#1360
  Closes #4826

* Output better error message if unsupported file formats are used with ``pyreverse``.

  Closes #5950

* Fix pyreverse diagrams type hinting for classmethods and staticmethods.

* Fix pyreverse diagrams type hinting for methods returning None.

* Fix matching ``--notes`` options that end in a non-word character.

  Closes #5840

* Updated the position of messages for class and function definitions to no longer cover
  the complete definition. Only the ``def`` or ``class`` + the name of the class/function
  are covered.

  Closes #5466

* ``using-f-string-in-unsupported-version`` and ``using-final-decorator-in-unsupported-version`` msgids
    were renamed from ``W1601`` and ``W1602`` to ``W2601`` and ``W2602``. Disabling using these msgids will break.
    This is done in order to restore consistency with the already existing msgids for ``apply-builtin`` and
    ``basestring-builtin`` from the now deleted python 3K+ checker. There is now a check that we're not using
    existing msgids or symbols from deleted checkers.

  Closes #5729

* The line numbering for messages related to function arguments is now more accurate. This can
  require some message disables to be relocated to updated positions.

* Add ``--recursive`` option to allow recursive discovery of all modules and packages in subtree. Running pylint with
  ``--recursive=y`` option will check all discovered ``.py`` files and packages found inside subtree of directory provided
  as parameter to pylint.

  Closes #352

* Add ``modified-iterating-list``, ``modified-iterating-dict`` and ``modified-iterating-set``,
  emitted when items are added to or removed from respectively a list, dictionary or
  set being iterated through.

  Closes #5348

* Fix false-negative for ``assignment-from-none`` checker using list.sort() method.

  Closes #5722

* New extension ``import-private-name``: indicate imports of external private packages
  and objects (prefixed with ``_``). It can be loaded using ``load-plugins=pylint.extensions.private_import``.

  Closes #5463

* Fixed crash from ``arguments-differ`` and ``arguments-renamed`` when methods were
  defined outside the top level of a class.

  Closes #5648

* Removed the deprecated ``check_docs`` extension. You can use the ``docparams`` checker
  to get the checks previously included in ``check_docs``.

  Closes #5322

* Added a ``testutil`` extra require to the packaging, as ``gitpython`` should not be a dependency
  all the time but is still required to use the primer helper code in ``pylint.testutil``. You can
  install it with ``pip install pylint[testutil]``.

  Closes #5486

* Reinstated checks from the python3 checker that are still useful for python 3
  (``eq-without-hash``). This is now in the ``pylint.extensions.eq_without_hash`` optional
  extension.

  Closes #5025

* Fixed an issue where ``ungrouped-imports`` could not be disabled without raising
  ``useless-suppression``.

  Refs #2366

* Added several checkers to deal with unicode security issues
  (see `Trojan Sources <https://trojansource.codes/>`_ and
  `PEP 672 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/>`_ for details) that also
  concern the readability of the code. In detail the following checks were added:

  * ``bad-file-encoding`` checks that the file is encoded in UTF-8 as suggested by
    `PEP8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#source-file-encoding>`_.
    UTF-16 and UTF-32 are `not supported by Python <https://bugs.python.org/issue1503789>`_
    at the moment. If this ever changes
    ``invalid-unicode-codec`` checks that they aren't used, to allow for backwards
    compatibility.

  * ``bidirectional-unicode`` checks for bidirectional unicode characters that
    could make code execution different than what the user expects.

  * ``invalid-character-backspace``, ``invalid-character-carriage-return``,
    ``invalid-character-sub``, ``invalid-character-esc``,
    ``invalid-character-zero-width-space`` and ``invalid-character-nul``
    to check for possibly harmful unescaped characters.

  Closes #5281

* Use the ``tomli`` package instead of ``toml`` to parse ``.toml`` files.

  Closes #5885

* Fix false positive - Allow unpacking of ``self`` in a subclass of ``typing.NamedTuple``.

  Closes #5312

* Fixed false negative ``unpacking-non-sequence`` when value is an empty list.

  Closes #5707

* Better warning messages for useless else or elif when a function returns early.

  Closes #5614

* Fixed false positive ``consider-using-dict-comprehension`` when creating a dict
  using a list of tuples where key AND value vary depending on the same condition.

  Closes #5588

* Fixed false positive for ``global-variable-undefined`` when ``global`` is used with a class name

  Closes #3088

* Fixed false positive for ``unused-variable`` when a ``nonlocal`` name is assigned as part of a multi-name assignment.

  Closes #3781

* Fixed a crash in ``unspecified-encoding`` checker when providing ``None``
  to the ``mode`` argument of an ``open()`` call.

  Closes #5731

* Fixed a crash involving a ``NewType`` named with an f-string.

  Closes #5770
  Ref PyCQA/astroid#1400

* Improved ``bad-open-mode`` message when providing ``None`` to the ``mode``
  argument of an ``open()`` call.

  Closes #5733

* Added ``lru-cache-decorating-method`` checker with checks for the use of ``functools.lru_cache``
  on class methods. This is unrecommended as it creates memory leaks by never letting the instance
  getting garbage collected.

  Closes #5670

* Fixed crash with recursion error for inference of class attributes that referenced
  the class itself.

  Closes #5408
  Ref PyCQA/astroid#1392

* Fixed false positive for ``unused-argument`` when a method overridden in a subclass
  does nothing with the value of a keyword-only argument.

  Closes #5771
  Ref PyCQA/astroid#1382

* The issue template for crashes is now created for crashes which were previously not covered
  by this mechanism.

  Closes #5668

* Rewrote checker for ``non-ascii-name``.
   It now ensures __all__ Python names are ASCII and also properly
   checks the names of imports (``non-ascii-module-import``) as
   well as file names (``non-ascii-file-name``) and emits their respective new warnings.

   Non ASCII characters could be homoglyphs (look alike characters) and hard to
   enter on a non specialized keyboard.
   See `Confusable Characters in PEP 672`_

* When run in parallel mode ``pylint`` now pickles the data passed to subprocesses with
  the ``dill`` package. The ``dill`` package has therefore been added as a dependency.

* An astroid issue where symlinks were not being taken into account
  was fixed

  Closes #1470
  Closes #3499
  Closes #4302
  Closes #4798

  expressions in a ternary operator test and using that expression as
  a call argument.

  Closes #5177, #5212

* Fix false positive for ``undefined-variable`` when ``namedtuple`` class
  attributes are used as return annotations.

  Closes #5568

* Fix false negative for ``undefined-variable`` and related variable messages
  when the same undefined variable is used as a type annotation and is
  accessed multiple times, or is used as a default argument to a function.

  Closes #5399

* Pyreverse - add output in mermaidjs format

* Emit ``used-before-assignment`` instead of ``undefined-variable`` when attempting
  to access unused type annotations.

  Closes #5713

* Added confidence level ``CONTROL_FLOW`` for warnings relying on assumptions
  about control flow.

* ``used-before-assignment`` now considers that assignments in a try block
  may not have occurred when the except or finally blocks are executed.

  Closes #85, #2615

* Fixed false negative for ``used-before-assignment`` when a conditional
  or context manager intervened before the try statement that suggested
  it might fail.

  Closes #4045

* Fixed false negative for ``used-before-assignment`` in finally blocks
  if an except handler did not define the assignment that might have failed
  in the try block.

* Fixed extremely long processing of long lines with comma's.

  Closes #5483

* Fixed crash on properties and inherited class methods when comparing them for
  equality against an empty dict.

  Closes #5646

* Fixed a false positive for ``assigning-non-slot`` when the slotted class
  defined ``__setattr__``.

  Closes #3793

* Fixed a false positive for ``invalid-class-object`` when the object
  being assigned to the ``__class__`` attribute is uninferable.

* Fixed false positive for ``used-before-assignment`` with self-referential type
  annotation in conditional statements within class methods.

  Closes #5499

* Add checker ``redefined-slots-in-subclass``: Emitted when a slot is redefined in a subclass.

  Closes #5617

* Fixed false positive for ``global-variable-not-assigned`` when the ``del`` statement is used

  Closes #5333

* By default, pylint does no longer take files starting with ``.#`` into account. Those are
  considered ``Emacs file locks``. See
  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Locks.html.
  This behavior can be reverted by redefining the ``ignore-patterns`` option.

  Closes #367

* Fixed a false positive for ``used-before-assignment`` when a named expression
  appears as the first value in a container.

  Closes #5112

* ``used-before-assignment`` now assumes that assignments in except blocks
  may not have occurred and warns accordingly.

  Closes #4761

* When evaluating statements after an except block, ``used-before-assignment``
  assumes that assignments in the except blocks took place if the
  corresponding try block contained a return statement.

  Closes #5500

* Fixed a false negative for ``used-before-assignment`` when some but not all
  except handlers defined a name relied upon after an except block when the
  corresponding try block contained a return statement.

  Closes #5524

* When evaluating statements in the ``else`` clause of a loop, ``used-before-assignment``
  assumes that assignments in the except blocks took place if the
  except handlers constituted the only ways for the loop to finish without
  breaking early.

  Closes #5683

* ``used-before-assignment`` now checks names in try blocks.

* Fixed false positive with ``used-before-assignment`` for assignment expressions
  in lambda statements.

  Closes #5360, #3877

* Fixed a false positive (affecting unreleased development) for
  ``used-before-assignment`` involving homonyms between filtered comprehensions
  and assignments in except blocks.

  Closes #5586

* Fixed crash with slots assignments and annotated assignments.

  Closes #5479

* Fixed crash on list comprehensions that used ``type`` as inner variable name.

  Closes #5461

* Fix false positive for ``unused-variable`` for a comprehension variable matching
  an outer scope type annotation.

  Closes #5326

* Fix false negative for ``undefined-variable`` for a variable used multiple times
  in a comprehension matching an unused outer scope type annotation.

  Closes #5654

* Some files in ``pylint.testutils`` were deprecated. In the future imports should be done from the
  ``pylint.testutils.functional`` namespace directly.

* Fixed false positives for ``no-value-for-parameter`` with variadic
  positional arguments.

  Closes #5416

* ``safe_infer`` no longer makes an inference when given two function
  definitions with differing numbers of arguments.

* Fix ``comparison-with-callable`` false positive for callables that raise, such
  as typing constants.

  Closes #5557

* Fixed a crash on ``__init__`` nodes when the attribute was previously uninferable due to a cache
  limit size. This limit can be hit when the inheritance pattern of a class (and therefore of the ``__init__`` attribute) is very large.

  Closes #5679

* Fix false positive for ``used-before-assignment`` from a class definition
  nested under a function subclassing a class defined outside the function.

  Closes #4590

  Closes #4434
  Closes #5370

* Fix false positive ``super-init-not-called`` for classes that inherit their ``init`` from
  a parent.

  Closes #4941

* ``encoding`` can now be supplied as a positional argument to calls that open
  files without triggering ``unspecified-encoding``.

  contained any statements

  Closes #5451

* ``fatal`` was added to the variables permitted in score evaluation expressions.

* The default score evaluation now uses a floor of 0.

  Closes #2399

* Fix false negative for ``consider-iterating-dictionary`` during membership checks encapsulated in iterables
  or ``not in`` checks

  Closes #5323

* Fixed crash on uninferable decorators on Python 3.6 and 3.7

* Add checker ``unnecessary-ellipsis``: Emitted when the ellipsis constant is used unnecessarily.

  Closes #5460

* Disable checker ``bad-docstring-quotes`` for Python <= 3.7, because in these versions the line
  numbers for decorated functions and classes are not reliable which interferes with the checker.

  Closes #3077

* Fixed incorrect classification of Numpy-style docstring as Google-style docstring for
  docstrings with property setter documentation.
  Docstring classification is now based on the highest amount of matched sections instead
  of the order in which the docstring styles were tried.

* Fixed detection of ``arguments-differ`` when superclass static
  methods lacked a ``@staticmethod`` decorator.

  Closes #5371

* ``TypingChecker``

  * Added new check ``broken-noreturn`` to detect broken uses of ``typing.NoReturn``
    if ``py-version`` is set to Python ``3.7.1`` or below.
    https://bugs.python.org/issue34921

  * Added new check ``broken-collections-callable`` to detect broken uses of ``collections.abc.Callable``
    if ``py-version`` is set to Python ``3.9.1`` or below.
    https://bugs.python.org/issue42965

* The ``testutils`` for unittests now accept ``end_lineno`` and ``end_column``. Tests
  without these will trigger a ``DeprecationWarning``.

* ``arguments-differ`` will no longer complain about method redefinitions with extra parameters
  that have default values.

  Closes #1556, #5338

* Fixed false positive ``unexpected-keyword-arg`` for decorators.

  Closes #258

* Importing the deprecated stdlib module ``xml.etree.cElementTree`` now emits ``deprecated_module``.

  in newer versions of Python no longer raise ``useless-suppression`` when linting with
  older Python interpreters where those features are not yet deprecated.

* Importing the deprecated stdlib module ``distutils`` now emits ``deprecated_module`` on Python 3.10+.

* ``missing-raises-doc`` will now check the class hierarchy of the raised exceptions

  .. code-block:: python

    def my_function():
      """My function.

      Raises:
        Exception: if something fails
      """
      raise ValueError

  Closes #4955

* Disable spellchecking of mypy rule names in ignore directives.

  Closes #5929

* Allow disabling ``duplicate-code`` with a disable comment when running through
  pylint.

  Closes #214

* Improve ``invalid-name`` check for ``TypeVar`` names.
  The accepted pattern can be customized with ``--typevar-rgx``.

  Closes #3401

* Added new checker ``typevar-name-missing-variance``. Emitted when a covariant
  or contravariant ``TypeVar`` does not end with  ``_co`` or ``_contra`` respectively or
  when a ``TypeVar`` is not either but has a suffix.

* Allow usage of mccabe 0.7.x release

  Closes #5878

* Fix ``unused-private-member`` false positive when accessing private methods through ``property``.

  Closes #4756
