:Date: 2023-03-08

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

2.17 is a small release that is the first to support python 3.11
officially with the addition of TryStar nodes.

There's still two new default checks: ``bad-chained-comparison`` and
``implicit-flag-alias``, one of them already fixed a previously
undetected bug in sentry.

Thanks to the community effort our documentation is almost complete,
and every messages should have a proper documentation now. A big thank
you to everyone who participated !

The next release is going to be ``3.0.0``, bring breaking changes and enact long
announced deprecations. There's going to be frequent beta releases,
before the official releases, everyone is welcome to try the betas
so we find problems before the actual release.
