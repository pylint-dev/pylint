 What's New in Pylint 2.16

   :maxdepth: 2

:Release: 2.16
:Date: 2023-02-01

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

In 2.16.0 we added aggregation and composition understanding in ``pyreverse``, and a way to clear
the cache in between run in server mode (originally for the VS Code integration). Apart from the bug
fixes there's also a lot of new checks, and new extensions that have been asked for for a long time
that were implemented.

If you want to benefit from all the new checks load the following plugins::

    pylint.extensions.dict_init_mutate,
    pylint.extensions.dunder,
    pylint.extensions.typing,
    pylint.extensions.magic_value,

We still welcome any community effort to help review, integrate, and add good/bad examples to the doc for
<https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5953>`_. This should be doable without any ``pylint`` or ``astroid``
knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to ``pylint`` or open source without
any experience with our code!

Last but not least @clavedeluna and @nickdrozd became triagers, welcome to the team !

What's new in Pylint 2.16.0?
----------------------------
Release date: 2023-02-01


Changes requiring user actions
------------------------------

- The ``accept-no-raise-doc`` option related to ``missing-raises-doc`` will now
  be correctly taken into account all the time.

  Pylint will no longer raise missing-raises-doc (W9006) when no exceptions are
  documented and accept-no-raise-doc is true (issue #7208).
  If you were expecting missing-raises-doc errors to be raised in that case,
  you
  will now have to add ``accept-no-raise-doc=no`` in your configuration to keep
  the same behavior.

  Closes #7208 (`#7208 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/7208>`_)



New Features
------------

- Added the ``no-header`` output format. If enabled with
  ``--output-format=no-header``, it will not include the module name in the
  output.

  Closes #5362 (`#5362 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5362>`_)

- Added configuration option ``clear-cache-post-run`` to support server-like
  usage.
  Use this flag if you expect the linted files to be altered between runs.

  Refs #5401 (`#5401 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5401>`_)

- Add ``--allow-reexport-from-package`` option to configure the
  ``useless-import-alias`` check not to emit a warning if a name
  is reexported from a package.

  Closes #6006 (`#6006 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/6006>`_)

- Update ``pyreverse`` to differentiate between aggregations and compositions.
  ``pyreverse`` checks if it's an Instance or a Call of an object via method
  parameters (via type hints)
  to decide if it's a composition or an aggregation.

  Refs #6543 (`#6543 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/6543>`_)

  functions.

  Closes #6917 (`#6917 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/6917>`_)

  statement to check for ``break`` condition as a first statement.

  Closes #8015 (`#8015 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/8015>`_)



Extensions
----------

  dictionary immediately

  Closes #2876 (`#2876 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2876>`_)

  fail.

  Specifically, if a plugin relies on the ``init-hook`` option changing
  ``sys.path`` before
  it can be imported, this will now emit a ``bad-plugin-value`` message. Before
  this
  change, it would silently fail to register the plugin for use, but would load
  any configuration, which could have unintended effects.

Internal Changes
----------------

- Add and fix regression tests for plugin loading.

  This shores up the tests that cover the loading of custom plugins as affected
  by any changes made to the ``sys.path`` during execution of an ``init-hook``.
  Given the existing contract of allowing plugins to be loaded by fiddling with
  the path in this way, this is now the last bit of work needed to close Github
  issue #7264.

  Closes #7264 (`#7264 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/7264>`_)
