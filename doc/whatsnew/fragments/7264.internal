Add and fix regression tests for plugin loading.

This shores up the tests that cover the loading of custom plugins as affected
by any changes made to the ``sys.path`` during execution of an ``init-hook``.
Given the existing contract of allowing plugins to be loaded by fiddling with
the path in this way, this is now the last bit of work needed to close Github
issue #7264.

Closes #7264
