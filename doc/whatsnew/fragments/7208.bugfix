The ``accept-no-raise-doc`` option related to ``missing-raises-doc`` will now be correctly
taken into account all the time. As the default value was false and was not taken into
account because of a bug, it means you will have to add ``accept-no-raise-doc=no`` in
your configuration to keep the same behavior.

Closes #7208
