Added ``consider-using-augmented-assign`` check for ``CodeStyle`` extension
which flags ``x = x + 1`` to simplify to ``x += 1``.
This check is disabled by default. To use it, load the code style extension
with ``load-plugins=pylint.extensions.code_style`` and add ``consider-using-augmented-assign`` in the ``enable`` option.

Closes #3391
