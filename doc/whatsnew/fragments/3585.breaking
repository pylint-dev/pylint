`invalid-name` now distinguishes module-level constants that are assigned only once
from those that are reassigned and now applies `--variable-rgx` to the latter. Values
other than literals (lists, sets, objects) can pass against either the constant or
variable regexes (e.g. "LOGGER" or "logger" but not "LoGgEr").

Remember that `--good-names` or `--good-names-rgxs` can be provided to explicitly
allow good names.

Closes #3585
