Fixed a multi-processing crash that prevents using any more than 1 thread on MacOS.

The returned module objects and errors that were cached by the linter plugin loader
cannot be reliably pickled. This means that ``dill`` would throw an error when
attempting to serialise the linter object for multi-processing use.

Closes #7635.
