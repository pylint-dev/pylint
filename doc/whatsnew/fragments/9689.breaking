`pyreverse` `Run` was changed to no longer call `sys.exit()` in its `__init__`.
You should now call `Run(args).run()` which will return the exit code instead.
Having a class that always raised a `SystemExit` exception was considered a bug.

Normal usage of pyreverse through the CLI will not be affected by this change.
