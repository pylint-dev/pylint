We migrated ``symilar`` to argparse, from getopt, so the error and help output changed
(for the better). We exit with 2 instead of sometime 1, sometime 2. The error output
is not captured by the runner anymore. It's not possible to use a value for the
boolean options anymore (``--ignore-comments 2`` should become ``--ignore-comments``).
