Add additional checks for suboptimal uses of class patterns in :keyword:`match`.
* :ref:`match-class-bind-self` is emitted if a name is bound to ``self`` instead of
  using an ``as`` pattern.
* :ref:`match-class-positional-attributes` is emitted if a class pattern has positional
  attributes when keywords could be used.
