Fixed crash in 'unnecessary-list-index-lookup' when starting an enumeration using
minus the length of an iterable inside a dict comprehension when the len call was only
made in this dict comprehension, and not elsewhere. Also changed the approach,
to use inference in all cases but the simple ones, so we don't have to fix crashes
one by one for arbitrarily complex expressions in enumerate.

Closes #10510
