The ``accept-no-raise-doc`` option related to ``missing-raises-doc`` will now
be correctly taken into account all the time.

Pylint will no longer raise missing-raises-doc (W9006) when no exceptions are
documented and accept-no-raise-doc is true (issue #7208).
If you were expecting missing-raises-doc errors to be raised in that case, you
will now have to add ``accept-no-raise-doc=no`` in your configuration to keep
the same behavior.

Closes #7208
