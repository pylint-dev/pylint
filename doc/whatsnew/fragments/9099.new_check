Added `too-many-positional-arguments` to allow distinguishing the configuration for too many
total arguments (with keyword-only params specified after `*`) from the configuration
for too many positional-or-keyword or positional-only arguments.

As part of evaluating whether this check makes sense for your project, ensure you
adjust the value of `--max-positional-arguments`.

Closes #9099
