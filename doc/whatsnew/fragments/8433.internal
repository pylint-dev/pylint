The following utilities are deprecated in favor of the more robust ``in_type_checking_block``
and will be removed in pylint 3.0:

  - ``is_node_in_guarded_import_block``
  - ``is_node_in_typing_guarded_import_block``
  - ``is_typing_guard``

``is_sys_guard`` is still available, which was part of ``is_node_in_guarded_import_block``.
