When checking for unbalanced dict unpacking in for-loops, Pylint will now test whether the length of each value to be
unpacked matches the number of unpacking targets. Previously, Pylint would test the number of values for the loop
iteration, which would produce a false unbalanced-dict-unpacking warning.
