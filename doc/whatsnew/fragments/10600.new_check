Add ``consider-rewriting-conditional`` check to the Code Style extension to suggest
``not (x and y)`` instead of ``not x or not y`` in order to facilitate the detection
of match case refactors. The code style extension must be enabled and
``consider-rewriting-conditional`` itself needs to be explicitly enabled.
