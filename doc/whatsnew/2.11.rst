***************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.11
***************************

:Release: 2.11
:Date: TBA

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Added ``consider-using-f-string``: Emitted when .format() or '%' is being used to format a string.

  Closes #3592


Extensions
==========


* Added new extension ``SetMembershipChecker`` with ``use-set-for-membership`` check:
  Emitted when using an in-place defined ``list`` or ``tuple`` to do a membership test. ``sets`` are better optimized for that.

  Closes #4776


* ``CodeStyleChecker``

  * Added ``consider-using-assignment-expr``: Emitted when an assignment is directly followed by an if statement
    and both can be combined by using an assignment expression ``:=``. Requires Python 3.8

    Closes #4862


Other Changes
=============

* Added ``py-version`` config key (if ``[MASTER]`` section). Used for version dependant checks.
  Will default to whatever Python version pylint is executed with.
