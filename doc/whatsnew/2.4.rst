**************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.4
**************************

:Release: 2.4
:Date: TBA


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* A new check ``class-variable-slots-conflict`` was added.

  This check is emitted when ``pylint`` finds a class variable that conflicts with a slot
  name, which would raise a ``ValueError`` at runtime.

  For example, the following would raise an error::

    class A:
        __slots__ = ('first', 'second')
        first = 1


Other Changes
=============

* A file is now read from stdin if the ``--from-stdin`` flag is used on the
  command line. In addition to the ``--from-stdin`` flag a (single) file
  name needs to be specified on the command line, which is needed for the
  report.
