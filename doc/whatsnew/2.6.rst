**************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.6
**************************

:Release: 2.6
:Date: TBA


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Add `super-with-arguments` check for flagging instances of Python 2 style super calls.

Other Changes
=============

* `bad-continuation` and `bad-whitespace` have been removed. `black` or another formatter can help you with this better than Pylint

* The `no-space-check`Â option has been removed, it's no longer possible to consider empty line like a `trailing-whitespace` by using clever options.

* `mixed-indentation` has been removed, it is no longer useful since TabError is included directly in python3
