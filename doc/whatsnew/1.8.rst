  What's New In Pylint 1.8
**************************

:Release: |release|
:Date: |TBA|


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

* None so far

New checkers
============

* A new check was added, ``bad-thread-instantiation``.

  This message is emitted when the threading.Thread class does not
  receive the target argument, but receives just one argument, which
  is by default the group parameter.

  In the following example, the instantiation will fail, which is definitely
  not desired:

  .. code-block:: python

     import threading
     threading.Thread(lambda: print(1)) # Oups, this is the group parameter

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing functions that have been
  removed from the itertools module ``izip``, ``imap``, ``iflter``, ``izip_longest``, and ``ifilterfalse``.

  .. code-block:: python

      from itertools import izip
      print(list(izip([1, 2], [3])))

  Instead use ``six.moves`` to import a Python 2 and Python 3 compatible function:

  .. code-block:: python

      from six.moves import zip
      print(list(zip([1, 2], [3])))

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing deprecated fields from
  the types module like ``ListType`` or ``IntType``

  .. code-block:: python

      from types import ListType
      print(isinstance([], ListType))

  Instead use the declarations in the builtin namespace:

  .. code-block:: python

      print(isinstance([], list))

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about declaring a ``next`` method that
  would have implemented the ``Iterator`` protocol in Python 2 but is now a normal
  method in Python 3.

  .. code-block:: python

      class Foo(object):
          def next(self):
              return 42

  Instead implement a ``__next__`` method and use ``six.Iterator`` as a base class
  or alias ``next`` to ``__next__``:

  .. code-block:: python

      class Foo(object):
          def __next__(self):
              return 42
          next = __next__


Other Changes
=============

* Raise meaningful exception in case of invalid reporter class (output format)
  being selected.

* The docparams extension now allows a property docstring to document both
  the property and the setter. Therefore setters can also have no docstring.

* The docparams extension now understands property type syntax.

  .. code-block:: python

      class Foo(object):
          @property
          def foo(self):
              """My Sphinx style docstring description.

              :type: int
              """
              return 10

  .. code-block:: python

    class Foo(object):
        @property
        def foo(self):
            """int: My Numpy and Google docstring style description."""
            return 10

* In case of ``--output-format=json``, the dictionary returned holds a new key-value pair.
  The key is ``message-id`` and the value the message id.

* A new Python 3.5 checker was added to warn about raising a ``StopIteration`` inside
  a generator
  
  .. code-block:: python

      def Generator(value=42):
          for i in range(value):
              if i**3 < value**2:
                  yield i
              else:
                  raise StopIteration

  Instead use a simple ``return`` statement

  .. code-block:: python

      def Generator(value=42):
          for i in range(value):
              if i**3 < value**2:
                  yield i
              else:
                  return

  The check about raising a StopIteration inside a generator is also valid if the exception
  raised inherit from StopIteration but only if this exception is defined inside the same module.
  Close #1385
