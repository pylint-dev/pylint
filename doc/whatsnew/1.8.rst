Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

* Added new checker class, `MagicNumberChecker` which warns about using literals
  in situations where constants we're predefined.

  Examples of invalid usage are:

  .. code-block:: python

    import re
    pattern = re.compile('\d.\d', 16)

    try:
        os.mkdir('x')
    except OSError as exc:
        if exc.errno != 17:
            raise

  Code snippets above should use `re.DOTALL` and `errno.EEXIST` respectively.


* Raise meaningful exception in case of invalid reporter class (output format)
  being selected.
