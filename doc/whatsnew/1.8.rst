Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

* Raise meaningful exception in case of invalid reporter class (output format)
  being selected.

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing functions that have been
  removed from the itertools module ``izip``, ``imap``, ``iflter``, ``izip_longest``, and ``ifilterfalse``.

  .. code-block:: python

      from itertools import izip
      print(list(izip([1, 2], [3])))

  Instead use ``six.moves`` to import a Python 2 and Python 3 compatible function:

  .. code-block:: python

      from six.moves import zip
      print(list(zip([1, 2], [3])))

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing deprecated fields from
  the types module like ``ListType`` or ``IntType``

  .. code-block:: python

      from types import ListType
      print(isinstance([], ListType))

  Instead use the declarations in the builtin namespace:

  .. code-block:: python

      print(isinstance([], list))

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about declaring a ``next`` method that
  would have implemented the ``Iterator`` protocol in Python 2 but is now a normal
  method in Python 3.

  .. code-block:: python

      class Foo(object):
          def next(self):
              return 42

  Instead implement a ``__next__`` method and use ``six.Iterator`` as a base class
  or alias ``next`` to ``__next__``:

  .. code-block:: python

      class Foo(object):
          def __next__(self):
              return 42
          next = __next__
