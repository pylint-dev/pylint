:Release: 2.8

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Add ``deprecated-argument`` check for deprecated arguments.

* Add new ``ConfusingConsecutiveElifChecker``. This checker emits a refactoring message (R5601 ``confusing-consecutive-elif``)
  if if/elif statements with different indentation levels follow directly one after the other.

Other Changes
=============

* Reduce usage of blacklist/whitelist terminology. Notably, ``extension-pkg-allow-list`` is an
  alternative to ``extension-pkg-whitelist`` and the message ``blacklisted-name`` is now emitted as
  ``disallowed-name``. The previous names are accepted to maintain backward compatibility.
