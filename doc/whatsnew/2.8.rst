**************************
 What's New in Pylint 2.8
**************************

:Release: 2.8
:Date: undefined

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Add ``deprecated-argument`` check for deprecated arguments.

Other Changes
=============

* Reduce usage of blacklist/whitelist terminology. Notably, ``extension-pkg-allow-list`` is an
  alternative to ``extension-pkg-whitelist`` and the message ``blacklisted-name`` is now emitted as
  ``disallowed-name``. The previous names are accepted to maintain backward compatibility.

* The packaging is now done via setuptools exclusively. ``doc``, ``tests``, ``man``, ``elisp`` and ``Changelog`` are
  not packaged anymore - reducing the size of the package by 75%.

* The 'doc' extra-require has been removed. ``pylint.version`` is now ``pylint.__version__`` and ``__pkginfo__`` does
  not contain the package metadata anymore.
