Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============


Other Changes
=============

* Ignore import x.y.z as z cases for checker `useless-import-alias`.

* `unnecessary-pass` is now also emitted when a function or class contains only docstring and pass statement, 
  in which case, docstring is enough for empty definition.

* Fix false positive ``undefined-variable`` and ``used-before-assignment`` with nonlocal keyword usage.

* Fix exceptions being raised when one of the params is not a ClassDef in checkers.utils.is_subclass_of.
