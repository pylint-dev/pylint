**************************

:Release: 2.2
:Date: TBA 

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============

* Add a new check `redundant-else` which is emitted if there is continue or break in previous if body. e.g

.. code-block:: python

    def foo():
        for i in range(10):
            if i < 3:
                continue
            else:  # [redundant-else]
                print(i)

    # better
    def foo():
        for i in range(10):
            if i < 3:
                continue
            print(i)

Other Changes
=============

* `unnecessary-pass` is now also emitted when a function or class contains only docstring and pass statement, 
  in which case, docstring is enough for empty definition.
