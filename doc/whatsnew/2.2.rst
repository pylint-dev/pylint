 What's New in Pylint 2.2
**************************

:Release: 2.2
:Date: TBA 

Summary -- Release highlights
=============================


New checkers
============


Other Changes
=============

* Ignore import x.y.z as z cases for checker `useless-import-alias`.

* `unnecessary-pass` is now also emitted when a function or class contains only docstring and pass statement, 
  in which case, docstring is enough for empty definition.

* Fix false positive ``undefined-variable`` and ``used-before-assignment`` with nonlocal keyword usage.

* Fix exceptions being raised when one of the params is not a ClassDef for :func:`checkers.utils.is_subclass_of`.

* ``pylint`` now picks the latest value from the inferred values of the exception that gets
  raised, when looking for ``raising-non-exception``. This helps when reusing a variable name
  for multiple types, since ``pylint`` was picking just the first inferred value, leading
  to spurious false positives.

  Close #2431

* ``pylint`` used to emit a ``not-an-iterable`` error when looking at coroutines built
  with ``asyncio.coroutine``. This is no longer the case as we handle coroutines explicitly.

  Close #996

* ``pylint`` used to emit a ``unused-variable`` error if unused import was found in the function. Now instead of
  ``unused-variable``, ``unused-import`` is emitted.

  Close #2421
