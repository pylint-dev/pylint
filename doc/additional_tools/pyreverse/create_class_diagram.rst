Creating Class Diagrams for Specific Classes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In many cases creating a single diagram depicting all classes in the project yields a rather unwieldy, giant diagram.
While limiting the input path to a single package or module can already help greatly to narrow down the scope, the ``-c`` option
provides another way to create a class diagram focusing on a single class and its collaborators.
For example, running::

  pyreverse -ASmy -c pylint.checkers.classes.ClassChecker pylint

will generate the full class and package diagrams for ``pylint``, but will additionally generate a file ``pylint.checkers.classes.ClassChecker.dot``:
