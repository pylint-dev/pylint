Pylint checkers' options and switches
-------------------------------------

Pylint checkers can provide three set of features:

* options that control their execution,
* messages that they can raise,
* reports that they can generate.

Below is a list of all checkers and their features.

Async checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``async``.

Async checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:not-async-context-manager (E1701): *Async context manager '%s' doesn't implement __aenter__ and __aexit__.*
  Used when an async context manager is used with an object that does not
  implement the async context management protocol. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python < 3.5.
:yield-inside-async-function (E1700): *Yield inside async function*
  Used when an `yield` or `yield from` statement is found inside an async
  function. This message can't be emitted when using Python < 3.5.


Bad-Chained-Comparison checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``bad-chained-comparison``.

Bad-Chained-Comparison checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:bad-chained-comparison (W3601): *Suspicious %s-part chained comparison using semantically incompatible operators (%s)*
  Used when there is a chained comparison where one expression is part of two
  comparisons that belong to different semantic groups ("<" does not mean the
  same thing as "is", chaining them in "0 < x is None" is probably a mistake).


Basic checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``basic``.

See also :ref:`basic checker's options' documentation <basic-options>`

Basic checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:not-in-loop (E0103): *%r not properly in loop*
  Used when break or continue keywords are used outside a loop.
:function-redefined (E0102): *%s already defined line %s*
  Used when a function / class / method is redefined.
:continue-in-finally (E0116): *'continue' not supported inside 'finally' clause*
  Emitted when the `continue` keyword is found inside a finally clause, which
  is a SyntaxError.
:abstract-class-instantiated (E0110): *Abstract class %r with abstract methods instantiated*
  Used when an abstract class with `abc.ABCMeta` as metaclass has abstract
  methods and is instantiated.
:star-needs-assignment-target (E0114): *Can use starred expression only in assignment target*
  Emitted when a star expression is not used in an assignment target.
:duplicate-argument-name (E0108): *Duplicate argument name %s in function definition*
  Duplicate argument names in function definitions are syntax errors.
:return-in-init (E0101): *Explicit return in __init__*
  Used when the special class method __init__ has an explicit return value.
:too-many-star-expressions (E0112): *More than one starred expression in assignment*
  Emitted when there are more than one starred expressions (`*x`) in an
  assignment. This is a SyntaxError.
:nonlocal-and-global (E0115): *Name %r is nonlocal and global*
  Emitted when a name is both nonlocal and global.
:used-prior-global-declaration (E0118): *Name %r is used prior to global declaration*
  Emitted when a name is used prior a global declaration, which results in an
  error since Python 3.6. This message can't be emitted when using Python <
  3.6.
:return-outside-function (E0104): *Return outside function*
  Used when a "return" statement is found outside a function or method.
:return-arg-in-generator (E0106): *Return with argument inside generator*
  Used when a "return" statement with an argument is found outside in a
  generator function or method (e.g. with some "yield" statements). This
  message can't be emitted when using Python >= 3.3.
:invalid-star-assignment-target (E0113): *Starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple*
  Emitted when a star expression is used as a starred assignment target.
:bad-reversed-sequence (E0111): *The first reversed() argument is not a sequence*
  Used when the first argument to reversed() builtin isn't a sequence (does not
  implement __reversed__, nor __getitem__ and __len__
:nonexistent-operator (E0107): *Use of the non-existent %s operator*
  Used when you attempt to use the C-style pre-increment or pre-decrement
  operator -- and ++, which doesn't exist in Python.
:yield-outside-function (E0105): *Yield outside function*
  Used when a "yield" statement is found outside a function or method.
:init-is-generator (E0100): *__init__ method is a generator*
  Used when the special class method __init__ is turned into a generator by a
  yield in its body.
:misplaced-format-function (E0119): *format function is not called on str*
  Emitted when format function is not called on str object. e.g doing
  print("value: {}").format(123) instead of print("value: {}".format(123)).
  This might not be what the user intended to do.
:nonlocal-without-binding (E0117): *nonlocal name %s found without binding*
  Emitted when a nonlocal variable does not have an attached name somewhere in
  the parent scopes
:lost-exception (W0150): *%s statement in finally block may swallow exception*
  Used when a break or a return statement is found inside the finally clause of
  a try...finally block: the exceptions raised in the try clause will be
  silently swallowed instead of being re-raised.
:assert-on-tuple (W0199): *Assert called on a populated tuple. Did you mean 'assert x,y'?*
  A call of assert on a tuple will always evaluate to true if the tuple is not
  empty, and will always evaluate to false if it is.
:assert-on-string-literal (W0129): *Assert statement has a string literal as its first argument. The assert will %s fail.*
  Used when an assert statement has a string literal as its first argument,
  which will cause the assert to always pass.
:self-assigning-variable (W0127): *Assigning the same variable %r to itself*
  Emitted when we detect that a variable is assigned to itself
:comparison-with-callable (W0143): *Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis?*
  This message is emitted when pylint detects that a comparison with a callable
  was made, which might suggest that some parenthesis were omitted, resulting
  in potential unwanted behaviour.
:nan-comparison (W0177): *Comparison %s should be %s*
  Used when an expression is compared to NaN values like numpy.NaN and
  float('nan').
:dangerous-default-value (W0102): *Dangerous default value %s as argument*
  Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary is detected in a default
  value for an argument.
:duplicate-key (W0109): *Duplicate key %r in dictionary*
  Used when a dictionary expression binds the same key multiple times.
:duplicate-value (W0130): *Duplicate value %r in set*
  This message is emitted when a set contains the same value two or more times.
:useless-else-on-loop (W0120): *Else clause on loop without a break statement, remove the else and de-indent all the code inside it*
  Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break
  statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as
  the loop itself.
:pointless-exception-statement (W0133): *Exception statement has no effect*
  Used when an exception is created without being assigned, raised or returned
  for subsequent use elsewhere.
:expression-not-assigned (W0106): *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing*
  Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.
  Probably something else was intended.
:confusing-with-statement (W0124): *Following "as" with another context manager looks like a tuple.*
  Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses
  name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as
  a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager
  returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context
  manager.
:unnecessary-lambda (W0108): *Lambda may not be necessary*
  Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same
  argument list as the lambda itself; such lambda expressions are in all but a
  few cases replaceable with the function being called in the body of the
  lambda.
:named-expr-without-context (W0131): *Named expression used without context*
  Emitted if named expression is used to do a regular assignment outside a
  context like if, for, while, or a comprehension.
:redeclared-assigned-name (W0128): *Redeclared variable %r in assignment*
  Emitted when we detect that a variable was redeclared in the same assignment.
:pointless-statement (W0104): *Statement seems to have no effect*
  Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.
:pointless-string-statement (W0105): *String statement has no effect*
  Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).
  This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily
  disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of
  comments.
:unnecessary-pass (W0107): *Unnecessary pass statement*
  Used when a "pass" statement that can be avoided is encountered.
:unreachable (W0101): *Unreachable code*
  Used when there is some code behind a "return" or "raise" statement, which
  will never be accessed.
:eval-used (W0123): *Use of eval*
  Used when you use the "eval" function, to discourage its usage. Consider
  using `ast.literal_eval` for safely evaluating strings containing Python
  expressions from untrusted sources.
:exec-used (W0122): *Use of exec*
  Raised when the 'exec' statement is used. It's dangerous to use this function
  for a user input, and it's also slower than actual code in general. This
  doesn't mean you should never use it, but you should consider alternatives
  first and restrict the functions available.
:using-constant-test (W0125): *Using a conditional statement with a constant value*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) uses a constant value
  for its test. This might not be what the user intended to do.
:missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test (W0126): *Using a conditional statement with potentially wrong function or method call due to missing parentheses*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) seems to wrongly call
  a function due to missing parentheses
:comparison-of-constants (R0133): *Comparison between constants: '%s %s %s' has a constant value*
  When two literals are compared with each other the result is a constant.
  Using the constant directly is both easier to read and more performant.
  Initializing 'True' and 'False' this way is not required since Python 2.3.
:literal-comparison (R0123): *In '%s', use '%s' when comparing constant literals not '%s' ('%s')*
  Used when comparing an object to a literal, which is usually what you do not
  want to do, since you can compare to a different literal than what was
  expected altogether.
:comparison-with-itself (R0124): *Redundant comparison - %s*
  Used when something is compared against itself.
:invalid-name (C0103): *%s name "%s" doesn't conform to %s*
  Used when the name doesn't conform to naming rules associated to its type
  (constant, variable, class...).
:singleton-comparison (C0121): *Comparison %s should be %s*
  Used when an expression is compared to singleton values like True, False or
  None.
:disallowed-name (C0104): *Disallowed name "%s"*
  Used when the name matches bad-names or bad-names-rgxs- (unauthorized names).
:empty-docstring (C0112): *Empty %s docstring*
  Used when a module, function, class or method has an empty docstring (it
  would be too easy ;).
:missing-class-docstring (C0115): *Missing class docstring*
  Used when a class has no docstring. Even an empty class must have a
  docstring.
:missing-function-docstring (C0116): *Missing function or method docstring*
  Used when a function or method has no docstring. Some special methods like
  __init__ do not require a docstring.
:missing-module-docstring (C0114): *Missing module docstring*
  Used when a module has no docstring. Empty modules do not require a
  docstring.
:typevar-name-incorrect-variance (C0105): *Type variable name does not reflect variance%s*
  Emitted when a TypeVar name doesn't reflect its type variance. According to
  PEP8, it is recommended to add suffixes '_co' and '_contra' to the variables
  used to declare covariant or contravariant behaviour respectively. Invariant
  (default) variables do not require a suffix. The message is also emitted when
  invariant variables do have a suffix.
:typevar-double-variance (C0131): *TypeVar cannot be both covariant and contravariant*
  Emitted when both the "covariant" and "contravariant" keyword arguments are
  set to "True" in a TypeVar.
:typevar-name-mismatch (C0132): *TypeVar name "%s" does not match assigned variable name "%s"*
  Emitted when a TypeVar is assigned to a variable that does not match its name
  argument.
:unidiomatic-typecheck (C0123): *Use isinstance() rather than type() for a typecheck.*
  The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use
  isinstance(x, Y) rather than type(x) == Y, type(x) is Y. Though there are
  unusual situations where these give different results.

Design checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``design``.

See also :ref:`design checker's options' documentation <design-options>`

Design checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:too-few-public-methods (R0903): *Too few public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.
:too-many-ancestors (R0901): *Too many ancestors (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many parent classes, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:too-many-arguments (R0913): *Too many arguments (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method takes too many arguments.
:too-many-boolean-expressions (R0916): *Too many boolean expressions in if statement (%s/%s)*
  Used when an if statement contains too many boolean expressions.
:too-many-branches (R0912): *Too many branches (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many branches, making it hard to
  follow.
:too-many-instance-attributes (R0902): *Too many instance attributes (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many instance attributes, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:too-many-locals (R0914): *Too many local variables (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many local variables.
:too-many-public-methods (R0904): *Too many public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:too-many-return-statements (R0911): *Too many return statements (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many return statement, making it hard
  to follow.
:too-many-statements (R0915): *Too many statements (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many statements. You should then split
  it in smaller functions / methods.


Exceptions checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``exceptions``.

See also :ref:`exceptions checker's options' documentation <exceptions-options>`

Exceptions checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:bad-except-order (E0701): *Bad except clauses order (%s)*
  Used when except clauses are not in the correct order (from the more specific
  to the more generic). If you don't fix the order, some exceptions may not be
  caught by the most specific handler.
:catching-non-exception (E0712): *Catching an exception which doesn't inherit from Exception: %s*
  Used when a class which doesn't inherit from Exception is used as an
  exception in an except clause.
:bad-exception-cause (E0705): *Exception cause set to something which is not an exception, nor None*
  Used when using the syntax "raise ... from ...", where the exception cause is
  not an exception, nor None.
:notimplemented-raised (E0711): *NotImplemented raised - should raise NotImplementedError*
  Used when NotImplemented is raised instead of NotImplementedError
:raising-bad-type (E0702): *Raising %s while only classes or instances are allowed*
  Used when something which is neither a class nor an instance is raised (i.e.
  a `TypeError` will be raised).
:raising-non-exception (E0710): *Raising a new style class which doesn't inherit from BaseException*
  Used when a new style class which doesn't inherit from BaseException is
  raised.
:misplaced-bare-raise (E0704): *The raise statement is not inside an except clause*
  Used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause. This generates an
  error, since there are no active exceptions to be reraised. An exception to
  this rule is represented by a bare raise inside a finally clause, which might
  work, as long as an exception is raised inside the try block, but it is
  nevertheless a code smell that must not be relied upon.
:duplicate-except (W0705): *Catching previously caught exception type %s*
  Used when an except catches a type that was already caught by a previous
  handler.
:broad-exception-caught (W0718): *Catching too general exception %s*
  If you use a naked ``except Exception:`` clause, you might end up catching
  exceptions other than the ones you expect to catch. This can hide bugs or
  make it harder to debug programs when unrelated errors are hidden.
:raise-missing-from (W0707): *Consider explicitly re-raising using %s'%s from %s'*
  Python's exception chaining shows the traceback of the current exception, but
  also of the original exception. When you raise a new exception after another
  exception was caught it's likely that the second exception is a friendly re-
  wrapping of the first exception. In such cases `raise from` provides a better
  link between the two tracebacks in the final error.
:raising-format-tuple (W0715): *Exception arguments suggest string formatting might be intended*
  Used when passing multiple arguments to an exception constructor, the first
  of them a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended
  for formatting
:binary-op-exception (W0711): *Exception to catch is the result of a binary "%s" operation*
  Used when the exception to catch is of the form "except A or B:". If
  intending to catch multiple, rewrite as "except (A, B):"
:wrong-exception-operation (W0716): *Invalid exception operation. %s*
  Used when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation is not
  valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having binary
  operations between exceptions in except handlers.
:bare-except (W0702): *No exception type(s) specified*
  A bare ``except:`` clause will catch ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt``
  exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with ``Control-C``, and
  can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that signal
  program errors, use ``except Exception:`` (bare except is equivalent to
  ``except BaseException:``).
:broad-exception-raised (W0719): *Raising too general exception: %s*
  Raising exceptions that are too generic force you to catch exceptions
  generically too. It will force you to use a naked ``except Exception:``
  clause. You might then end up catching exceptions other than the ones you
  expect to catch. This can hide bugs or make it harder to debug programs when
  unrelated errors are hidden.
:try-except-raise (W0706): *The except handler raises immediately*
  Used when an except handler uses raise as its first or only operator. This is
  useless because it raises back the exception immediately. Remove the raise
  operator or the entire try-except-raise block!

See also :ref:`logging checker's options' documentation <logging-options>`

Logging checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:logging-format-truncated (E1201): *Logging format string ends in middle of conversion specifier*
  Used when a logging statement format string terminates before the end of a
  conversion specifier.
:logging-too-few-args (E1206): *Not enough arguments for logging format string*
  Used when a logging format string is given too few arguments.
:logging-too-many-args (E1205): *Too many arguments for logging format string*

:logging-unsupported-format (E1200): *Unsupported logging format character %r (%#02x) at index %d*
  Used when an unsupported format character is used in a logging statement
  format string.
:logging-format-interpolation (W1202): *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string.format(format_args...))". Use another type of string
  formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the
  logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-
  interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-
  not-lazy is disabled then you can use % formatting as normal.
:logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203): *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(f"...")".Use another type of string formatting instead. You can use %
  formatting but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the
  parameters as arguments. If logging-format-interpolation is disabled then you
  can use str.format. If logging-not-lazy is disabled then you can use %
  formatting as normal.
:logging-not-lazy (W1201): *Use %s formatting in logging functions*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string % (format_args...))". Use another type of string
  formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the
  logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-
  interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-
  format-interpolation is disabled then you can use str.format.


Method Args checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``method_args``.

See also :ref:`method_args checker's options' documentation <method_args-options>`

Method Args checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:positional-only-arguments-expected (E3102): *`%s()` got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: %s*
  Emitted when positional-only arguments have been passed as keyword arguments.
  Remove the keywords for the affected arguments in the function call. This
  message can't be emitted when using Python < 3.8.
:missing-timeout (W3101): *Missing timeout argument for method '%s' can cause your program to hang indefinitely*
  Used when a method needs a 'timeout' parameter in order to avoid waiting for
  a long time. If no timeout is specified explicitly the default value is used.
  For example for 'requests' the program will never time out (i.e. hang
  indefinitely).

  Used when a warning note as FIXME or XXX is detected.
:use-symbolic-message-instead (I0023):
  Used when a message is enabled or disabled by id.


Modified Iteration checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``modified_iteration``.

Modified Iteration checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:modified-iterating-dict (E4702): *Iterated dict '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, iterate through a copy of it instead.*
  Emitted when items are added or removed to a dict being iterated through.
  Doing so raises a RuntimeError.
:modified-iterating-set (E4703): *Iterated set '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, iterate through a copy of it instead.*
  Emitted when items are added or removed to a set being iterated through.
  Doing so raises a RuntimeError.
:modified-iterating-list (W4701): *Iterated list '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, consider iterating through a copy of it instead.*
  Emitted when items are added or removed to a list being iterated through.
  Doing so can result in unexpected behaviour, that is why it is preferred to
  use a copy of the list.


Nested Min Max checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``nested_min_max``.

Nested Min Max checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:nested-min-max (W3301): *Do not use nested call of '%s'; it's possible to do '%s' instead*
  Nested calls ``min(1, min(2, 3))`` can be rewritten as ``min(1, 2, 3)``.


Newstyle checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``newstyle``.

Newstyle checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:bad-super-call (E1003): *Bad first argument %r given to super()*
  Used when another argument than the current class is given as first argument
  of the super builtin.


Nonascii-Checker checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``nonascii-checker``.

Nonascii-Checker checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:non-ascii-file-name (W2402): *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII character.*
  Under python 3.5, PEP 3131 allows non-ascii identifiers, but not non-ascii
  file names.Since Python 3.5, even though Python supports UTF-8 files, some
  editors or tools don't.
:non-ascii-name (C2401): *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII character, consider renaming it.*
  Used when the name contains at least one non-ASCII unicode character. See
  https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/#confusing-features for a background why
  this could be bad. If your programming guideline defines that you are
  programming in English, then there should be no need for non ASCII characters
  in Python Names. If not you can simply disable this check.
:non-ascii-module-import (C2403): *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII character, use an ASCII-only alias for import.*
  Used when the name contains at least one non-ASCII unicode character. See
  https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/#confusing-features for a background why
  this could be bad. If your programming guideline defines that you are
  programming in English, then there should be no need for non ASCII characters
  in Python Names. If not you can simply disable this check.


Refactoring checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``refactoring``.

See also :ref:`refactoring checker's options' documentation <refactoring-options>`

Refactoring checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:simplifiable-condition (R1726): *Boolean condition '%s' may be simplified to '%s'*
  Emitted when a boolean condition is able to be simplified.
:condition-evals-to-constant (R1727): *Boolean condition '%s' will always evaluate to '%s'*
  Emitted when a boolean condition can be simplified to a constant value.
:simplify-boolean-expression (R1709): *Boolean expression may be simplified to %s*
  Emitted when redundant pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:consider-using-in (R1714): *Consider merging these comparisons with 'in' by using '%s %sin (%s)'. Use a set instead if elements are hashable.*
  To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, combine the values
  into a set or tuple and check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of
  checking for equality against each of the values. This is faster and less
  verbose.
:consider-merging-isinstance (R1701): *Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(%s, (%s))*
  Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one.
:use-dict-literal (R1735): *Consider using '%s' instead of a call to 'dict'.*
  Emitted when using dict() to create a dictionary instead of a literal '{ ...
  }'. The literal is faster as it avoids an additional function call.
:consider-using-max-builtin (R1731): *Consider using '%s' instead of unnecessary if block*
  Using the max builtin instead of a conditional improves readability and
  conciseness.
:consider-using-min-builtin (R1730): *Consider using '%s' instead of unnecessary if block*
  Using the min builtin instead of a conditional improves readability and
  conciseness.
:consider-using-sys-exit (R1722): *Consider using 'sys.exit' instead*
  Contrary to 'exit()' or 'quit()', 'sys.exit' does not rely on the site module
  being available (as the 'sys' module is always available).
:consider-using-with (R1732): *Consider using 'with' for resource-allocating operations*
  Emitted if a resource-allocating assignment or call may be replaced by a
  'with' block. By using 'with' the release of the allocated resources is
  ensured even in the case of an exception.
:super-with-arguments (R1725): *Consider using Python 3 style super() without arguments*
  Emitted when calling the super() builtin with the current class and instance.
  On Python 3 these arguments are the default and they can be omitted.
:use-list-literal (R1734): *Consider using [] instead of list()*
  Emitted when using list() to create an empty list instead of the literal [].
  The literal is faster as it avoids an additional function call.
:consider-using-dict-comprehension (R1717): *Consider using a dictionary comprehension*
  Emitted when we detect the creation of a dictionary using the dict() callable
  and a transient list. Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this
  code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension. Also
  it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list
:consider-using-generator (R1728): *Consider using a generator instead '%s(%s)'*
  If your container can be large using a generator will bring better
  performance.
:consider-using-set-comprehension (R1718): *Consider using a set comprehension*
  Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to
  read and can be simplified to a set comprehension. Also it is faster since
  you don't need to create another transient list
:consider-using-get (R1715): *Consider using dict.get for getting values from a dict if a key is present or a default if not*
  Using the builtin dict.get for getting a value from a dictionary if a key is
  present or a default if not, is simpler and considered more idiomatic,
  although sometimes a bit slower
:consider-using-join (R1713): *Consider using str.join(sequence) for concatenating strings from an iterable*
  Using str.join(sequence) is faster, uses less memory and increases
  readability compared to for-loop iteration.
:consider-using-ternary (R1706): *Consider using ternary (%s)*
  Used when one of known pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:consider-swap-variables (R1712): *Consider using tuple unpacking for swapping variables*
  You do not have to use a temporary variable in order to swap variables. Using
  "tuple unpacking" to directly swap variables makes the intention more clear.
:trailing-comma-tuple (R1707): *Disallow trailing comma tuple*
  In Python, a tuple is actually created by the comma symbol, not by the
  parentheses. Unfortunately, one can actually create a tuple by misplacing a
  trailing comma, which can lead to potential weird bugs in your code. You
  should always use parentheses explicitly for creating a tuple.
:stop-iteration-return (R1708): *Do not raise StopIteration in generator, use return statement instead*
  According to PEP479, the raise of StopIteration to end the loop of a
  generator may lead to hard to find bugs. This PEP specify that raise
  StopIteration has to be replaced by a simple return statement
:inconsistent-return-statements (R1710): *Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should.*
  According to PEP8, if any return statement returns an expression, any return
  statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return
  None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the
  function (if reachable)
:redefined-argument-from-local (R1704): *Redefining argument with the local name %r*
  Used when a local name is redefining an argument, which might suggest a
  potential error. This is taken in account only for a handful of name binding
  operations, such as for iteration, with statement assignment and exception
  handler assignment.
:chained-comparison (R1716): *Simplify chained comparison between the operands*
  This message is emitted when pylint encounters boolean operation like "a < b
  and b < c", suggesting instead to refactor it to "a < b < c"
:simplifiable-if-expression (R1719): *The if expression can be replaced with %s*
  Used when an if expression can be replaced with 'bool(test)' or simply 'test'
  if the boolean cast is implicit.
:simplifiable-if-statement (R1703): *The if statement can be replaced with %s*
  Used when an if statement can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.
:too-many-nested-blocks (R1702): *Too many nested blocks (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the
  code less understandable and maintainable.
:no-else-break (R1723): *Unnecessary "%s" after "break", %s*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a break statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a break statement.
:no-else-continue (R1724): *Unnecessary "%s" after "continue", %s*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a continue statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a continue statement.
:no-else-raise (R1720): *Unnecessary "%s" after "raise", %s*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a raise statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a raise statement.
:no-else-return (R1705): *Unnecessary "%s" after "return", %s*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.
:unnecessary-dict-index-lookup (R1733): *Unnecessary dictionary index lookup, use '%s' instead*
  Emitted when iterating over the dictionary items (key-item pairs) and
  accessing the value by index lookup. The value can be accessed directly
  instead.
:unnecessary-list-index-lookup (R1736): *Unnecessary list index lookup, use '%s' instead*
  Emitted when iterating over an enumeration and accessing the value by index
  lookup. The value can be accessed directly instead.
:unnecessary-comprehension (R1721): *Unnecessary use of a comprehension, use %s instead.*
  Instead of using an identity comprehension, consider using the list, dict or
  set constructor. It is faster and simpler.
:use-a-generator (R1729): *Use a generator instead '%s(%s)'*
  Comprehension inside of 'any', 'all', 'max', 'min' or 'sum' is unnecessary. A
  generator would be sufficient and faster.
:useless-return (R1711): *Useless return at end of function or method*
  Emitted when a single "return" or "return None" statement is found at the end
  of function or method definition. This statement can safely be removed
  because Python will implicitly return None
:use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison (C1803): *'%s' can be simplified to '%s' as an empty %s is falsey*
  Used when Pylint detects that collection literal comparison is being used to
  check for emptiness; Use implicit booleaness instead of a collection classes;
  empty collections are considered as false
:unneeded-not (C0113): *Consider changing "%s" to "%s"*
  Used when a boolean expression contains an unneeded negation.
:consider-iterating-dictionary (C0201): *Consider iterating the dictionary directly instead of calling .keys()*
  Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the ``.keys()``
  method or when ``.keys()`` is used for a membership check. It is enough to
  iterate through the dictionary itself, ``for key in dictionary``. For
  membership checks, ``if key in dictionary`` is faster.
:consider-using-dict-items (C0206): *Consider iterating with .items()*
  Emitted when iterating over the keys of a dictionary and accessing the value
  by index lookup. Both the key and value can be accessed by iterating using
  the .items() method of the dictionary instead.
:consider-using-enumerate (C0200): *Consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len*
  Emitted when code that iterates with range and len is encountered. Such code
  can be simplified by using the enumerate builtin.
:use-implicit-booleaness-not-len (C1802): *Do not use `len(SEQUENCE)` without comparison to determine if a sequence is empty*
  Used when Pylint detects that len(sequence) is being used without explicit
  comparison inside a condition to determine if a sequence is empty. Instead of
  coercing the length to a boolean, either rely on the fact that empty
  sequences are false or compare the length against a scalar.
:consider-using-f-string (C0209): *Formatting a regular string which could be a f-string*
  Used when we detect a string that is being formatted with format() or % which
  could potentially be a f-string. The use of f-strings is preferred. Requires
  Python 3.6 and ``py-version >= 3.6``.
:use-maxsplit-arg (C0207): *Use %s instead*
  Emitted when accessing only the first or last element of str.split(). The
  first and last element can be accessed by using str.split(sep, maxsplit=1)[0]
  or str.rsplit(sep, maxsplit=1)[-1] instead.
:use-sequence-for-iteration (C0208): *Use a sequence type when iterating over values*
  When iterating over values, sequence types (e.g., ``lists``, ``tuples``,
  ``ranges``) are more efficient than ``sets``.

  Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file.
  This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this
  duplication.

Verbatim name of the checker is ``spelling``.

See also :ref:`spelling checker's options' documentation <spelling-options>`

Spelling checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:invalid-characters-in-docstring (C0403): *Invalid characters %r in a docstring*
  Used when a word in docstring cannot be checked by enchant.
:wrong-spelling-in-comment (C0401): *Wrong spelling of a word '%s' in a comment:*
  Used when a word in comment is not spelled correctly.
:wrong-spelling-in-docstring (C0402): *Wrong spelling of a word '%s' in a docstring:*
  Used when a word in docstring is not spelled correctly.


Stdlib checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``stdlib``.

Stdlib checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:invalid-envvar-value (E1507): *%s does not support %s type argument*
  Env manipulation functions support only string type arguments. See
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv.
:singledispatch-method (E1519): *singledispatch decorator should not be used with methods, use singledispatchmethod instead.*
  singledispatch should decorate functions and not class/instance methods. Use
  singledispatchmethod for those cases.
:singledispatchmethod-function (E1520): *singledispatchmethod decorator should not be used with functions, use singledispatch instead.*
  singledispatchmethod should decorate class/instance methods and not
  functions. Use singledispatch for those cases.
:bad-open-mode (W1501): *"%s" is not a valid mode for open.*
  Python supports: r, w, a[, x] modes with b, +, and U (only with r) options.
  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
:invalid-envvar-default (W1508): *%s default type is %s. Expected str or None.*
  Env manipulation functions return None or str values. Supplying anything
  different as a default may cause bugs. See
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv.
:method-cache-max-size-none (W1518): *'lru_cache(maxsize=None)' or 'cache' will keep all method args alive indefinitely, including 'self'*
  By decorating a method with lru_cache or cache the 'self' argument will be
  linked to the function and therefore never garbage collected. Unless your
  instance will never need to be garbage collected (singleton) it is
  recommended to refactor code to avoid this pattern or add a maxsize to the
  cache. The default value for maxsize is 128.
:subprocess-run-check (W1510): *'subprocess.run' used without explicitly defining the value for 'check'.*
  The ``check`` keyword is set to False by default. It means the process
  launched by ``subprocess.run`` can exit with a non-zero exit code and fail
  silently. It's better to set it explicitly to make clear what the error-
  handling behavior is.
:forgotten-debug-statement (W1515): *Leaving functions creating breakpoints in production code is not recommended*
  Calls to breakpoint(), sys.breakpointhook() and pdb.set_trace() should be
  removed from code that is not actively being debugged.
:redundant-unittest-assert (W1503): *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r*
  The first argument of assertTrue and assertFalse is a condition. If a
  constant is passed as parameter, that condition will be always true. In this
  case a warning should be emitted.
:shallow-copy-environ (W1507): *Using copy.copy(os.environ). Use os.environ.copy() instead.*
  os.environ is not a dict object but proxy object, so shallow copy has still
  effects on original object. See https://bugs.python.org/issue15373 for
  reference.
:boolean-datetime (W1502): *Using datetime.time in a boolean context.*
  Using datetime.time in a boolean context can hide subtle bugs when the time
  they represent matches midnight UTC. This behaviour was fixed in Python 3.5.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue13936 for reference. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python >= 3.5.
:deprecated-argument (W4903): *Using deprecated argument %s of method %s()*
  The argument is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.
:deprecated-class (W4904): *Using deprecated class %s of module %s*
  The class is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.
:deprecated-decorator (W4905): *Using deprecated decorator %s()*
  The decorator is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.
:deprecated-method (W4902): *Using deprecated method %s()*
  The method is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.
:unspecified-encoding (W1514): *Using open without explicitly specifying an encoding*
  It is better to specify an encoding when opening documents. Using the system
  default implicitly can create problems on other operating systems. See
  https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/
:subprocess-popen-preexec-fn (W1509): *Using preexec_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of threads*
  The preexec_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads in
  your application. The child process could deadlock before exec is called. If
  you must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number of libraries you call
  into. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor
:bad-thread-instantiation (W1506): *threading.Thread needs the target function*
  The warning is emitted when a threading.Thread class is instantiated without
  the target function being passed as a kwarg or as a second argument. By
  default, the first parameter is the group param, not the target param.

  bidirectional unicode are typically not displayed characters required to
  display right-to-left (RTL) script (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew,
  ...) correctly. So can you trust this code? Are you sure it displayed
  correctly in all editors? If you did not write it or your language is not
  RTL, remove the special characters, as they could be used to trick you into
  executing code, that does something else than what it looks like. More
  Information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_text
  https://trojansource.codes/
:invalid-character-backspace (E2510): *Invalid unescaped character backspace, use "\b" instead.*

  Mostly end of input for python.
:invalid-character-sub (E2512): *Invalid unescaped character sub, use "\x1A" instead.*
  Ctrl+Z "End of text" on Windows. Some programs (such as type) ignore the rest
  of the file after it.
:invalid-character-zero-width-space (E2515): *Invalid unescaped character zero-width-space, use "\u200B" instead.*
  Invisible space character could hide real code execution.
:invalid-unicode-codec (E2501): *UTF-16 and UTF-32 aren't backward compatible. Use UTF-8 instead*
  For compatibility use UTF-8 instead of UTF-16/UTF-32. See also
  https://bugs.python.org/issue1503789 for a history of this issue. And
  https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/102205/ for some
  possible problems when using UTF-16 for instance.
:bad-file-encoding (C2503): *PEP8 recommends UTF-8 as encoding for Python files*
