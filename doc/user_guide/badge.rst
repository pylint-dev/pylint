If you use GitHub Actions, and one of your CI workflows begins with "name: pylint", you
can use GitHub's `workflow status badges <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge#using-the-workflow-file-name>`_
to show an up-to-date indication of whether pushes to your default branch pass pylint.
For more detailed information, check the documentation.
