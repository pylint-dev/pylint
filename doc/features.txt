  In error mode, checkers without error messages are disabled and for others,
  only the ERROR messages are displayed, and no reports are done by default
:profile:
  Profiled execution.
:ignore:
  Add <file or directory> to the black list. It should be a base name, not a
  path. You may set this option multiple times.

  Default: ``CVS``

  Pickle collected data for later comparisons.

  Default: ``yes``
:load-plugins:
  List of plugins (as comma separated values of python modules names) to load,
  usually to register additional checkers.
:long-help:
  more verbose help.

Commands options

  comma separated list of message ids.
:list-msgs:
  Generate pylint's messages.

  configuration.
:generate-man:

Messages control options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:enable:
  Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
  either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
  multiple time.
:disable:
  Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
  can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
  multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
  it should appear only once).

  (visual studio) and html

  Default: ``text``
:include-ids:
  Include message's id in output
:files-output:

:reports:
  Tells whether to display a full report or only the messages

  Default: ``yes``
:evaluation:
  Python expression which should return a note less than 10 (10 is the highest

  (RP0004).

  method>(format_string % (format_args...))". Such calls should leave string
  interpolation to the logging method itself and be written "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string, format_args...)" so that the program may avoid
  incurring the cost of the interpolation in those cases in which no message
  will be logged. For more, see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0282/.

  for an argument.
:W0104: *Statement seems to have no effect*
  Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.
:W0105: *String statement has no effect*
  Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).
  This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily
  disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of
  comments.
:W0106: *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing',*
  Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing. 
  Probably something else was intended.
