This message can be raised on your own code using a `custom deprecation checker`_ (follow link for a full example).

Loading this custom checker using ``load-plugins`` would start raising ``deprecated-argument``.

The actual replacement then need to be studied on a case by case basis by reading the
deprecation warning or the release notes.
