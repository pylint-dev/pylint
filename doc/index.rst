Pylint documentation
====================

Pylint is a `static code analyser`_ for Python 2 or 3. The latest version supports Python
3.7.2 and above.

Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding
standard, looks for `code smells`_, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.

Projects that you might want to use alongside pylint include flake8_ (faster and simpler checks
with very few false positives), mypy_, pyright_ or pyre_ (typing checks), bandit_ (security
oriented checks), black_ and isort_ (auto-formatting), autoflake_ (automated removal of
unused import or variable), pyupgrade_ (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and
pydocstringformatter_ (automated pep257).

Pylint can infer actual values from your code using its internal code representation (astroid).
If your code is ``import logging as argparse``, Pylint will know that ``argparse.error(...)``
is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call.

Pylint isn't smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have
conscientiously done or checks for some things that you don't care about.
During adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced,
it's best to start with the ``--errors-only`` flag, then disable
convention and refactor message with ``--disable=C,R`` and progressively
re-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.


Pylint ships with two additional tools:

- :ref:`pyreverse <pyreverse>` (standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.)
- :ref:`symilar <symilar>`  (duplicate code finder that is also integrated in pylint)
