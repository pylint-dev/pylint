------------------
Pylint's ChangeLog
------------------
What's New in Pylint 1.8?
=========================

    * Respect disable=... in config file when running with --py3k.

    * New warning `shallow-copy-environ` added

      Shallow copy of os.environ doesn't work as people may expect. os.environ
      is not a dict object but rather a proxy object, so any changes made
      on copy may have unexpected effects on os.environ

      Instead of copy.copy(os.environ) method os.environ.copy() should be
      used.

      See https://bugs.python.org/issue15373 for details.

      Close #1301

    * Do not display no-absolute-import warning multiple times per file.

    * `trailing-comma-tuple` refactor check now extends to assignment with
       more than one element (such as lists)

      Close #1713

    * Fixing u'' string in superfluous-parens message 

      Close #1420

    * `abstract-class-instantiated` is now emitted for all inference paths.

       Close #1673

    * Add set of predefined naming style to ease configuration of checking
      naming conventions.

      Closes #1013

    * Added a new check, ``keyword-arg-before-vararg``

      This is emitted for function definitions
      in which keyword arguments are placed before variable
      positional arguments (*args).

      This may lead to args list getting modified if keyword argument's value
      is not provided in the function call assuming it will take default value
      provided in the definition.
	
    * The `invalid-name` check contains the name of the template that caused the failure

      Close #1176

    * Using the -j flag won't start more child linters than needed.

      Contributed by Roman Ivanov in #1614

    * Fix a false positive with bad-python3-import on relative imports

      Close #1608

    * Added a new Python 3 check, ``non-ascii-bytes-literals``

      Close #1545

    * Added a couple of new Python 3 checks for accessing dict methods in non-iterable context

    * Protocol checks (not-a-mapping, not-an-iterable and co.) aren't emitted on classes with dynamic getattr

    * Added a new warning, 'bad-thread-instantiation'

      This message is emitted when the threading.Thread class does not
      receive the target argument, but receives just one argument, which
      is by default the group parameter.

      Close #1327

    * In non-quiet mode, absolute path of used config file is logged to
      standard error.
      Close #1519

    * Raise meaningful exception for invalid reporter class being selected

      When unknown reporter class will be selected as Pylint reporter,
      meaningful error message would be raised instead of bare ``ImportError``
      or ``AttribueError`` related to module or reporter class being not found.
      Close #1388

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing removed functions from itertools
      like ``izip`` or ``ifilterfalse``

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing removed fields from the types
      module like ``UnicodeType`` or ``XRangeType``

    * Added a new Python 3 check for declaring a method ``next`` that would have
      been treated as an iterator in Python 2 but a normal function in Python 3.

    * Added a new key-value pair in json output. The key is ``message-id``
      and the value is the message id.
      Close #1512
		
    * Added a new Python 3.0 check for raising a StopIteration inside a generator.
      The check about raising a StopIteration inside a generator is also valid if the exception
      raised inherit from StopIteration.
      Close #1385

    * Added a new warning, ``raising-format-tuple``, to detect multi-argument
      exception construction instead of message string formatting.

    * Added a new check for method of logging module that concatenate string via + operator
      Close #1479

    * Added parameter for limiting number of suggestions in spellchecking checkers

    * Fix a corner-case in ``consider-using-ternary`` checker.

      When object ``A`` used in  ``X and A or B`` was falsy in boolean context,
      Pylint incorrectly emitted non-equivalent ternary-based suggestion.
      After a change message is correctly not emitted for this case.
      Close #1559

    * Added ``suggestion-mode`` configuration flag. When flag is enabled, informational
      message is emitted instead of cryptic error message for attributes accessed on
      c-extensions.
      Close #1466

    * Fix a false positive ``useless-super-delegation`` message when
      parameters default values are different from those used in the base class.
      Close #1085

    * Disabling 'wrong-import-order', 'wrong-import-position', or
      'ungrouped-imports' for a single line now prevents that line from
      triggering violations on subsequent lines.

      Close #1336

    * Added a new Python check for inconsistent return statements inside method or function.
      Close #1267

    * Fix ``superfluous-parens`` false positive related to handling logical statements
      involving ``in`` operator.

      Close #574

    * ``function-redefined`` message is no longer emitted for functions and
      methods which names matches dummy variable name regular expression.
      Close #1369

    * Fix ``missing-param-doc`` and ``missing-type-doc`` false positives when
      mixing ``Args`` and ``Keyword Args`` in Google docstring.
      Close #1409

     * Fix ``missing-docstring`` false negatives when modules, classes, or methods
     consist of compound statements that exceed the ``docstring-min-length``

    * Fix ``useless-else-on-loop`` false positives when break statements are
      deeply nested inside loop.
      Close #1661

    * Fix no ``wrong-import-order`` message emitted on ordering of first and third party
      libraries. With this fix, pylint distinguishes third and first party
      modules when checking import order.
      Close #1702

What's New in Pylint 1.7.1?
=========================

Release date: 2017-04-17

    * Fix a false positive which occurred when an exception was reraised

      Close #1419

    * Fix a false positive of ``disallow-trailing-tuple``

      The check was improved by verifying for non-terminating newlines, which
      should exempt function calls and function definitions from the check
      Close #1424


What's New in Pylint 1.7?
=========================

Release date: 2017-04-13

    * Don't emit missing-final-newline or trailing-whitespace for formfeeds (page breaks).

      Close #1218 and #1219

    * Don't emit by default no-member if we have opaque inference objects in the inference results

      This is controlled through the new flag ignore-on-opaque-inference, which is by
      default True. The inference can return  multiple potential results while
      evaluating a Python object, but some branches might not be evaluated, which
      results in partial inference. In that case, it might be useful to still emit
      no-member and other checks for the rest of the inferred objects.

    * Added new message `assign-to-new-keyword` to warn about assigning to names which
      will become a keyword in future Python releases.

      Close #1351

    * Split the 'missing or differing' in parameter documentation in different error.
      'differing-param-doc' covers the differing part of the old 'missing-param-doc',
      and 'differing-type-doc' covers the differing part of the old 'missing-type-doc'

      Close #1342

    * Added a new error, 'used-prior-global-declaration', which is emitted when a name
      is used prior a global declaration in a function. This causes a SyntaxError in
      Python 3.6

      Close #1257

    * The protocol checks are emitting their messages when a special method is set to None.

      Close #1263

    * Properly detect if imported name is assigned to same name in different
      scope.

      Close #636, #848, #851, and #900

    * Require one space for annotations with type hints, as per PEP 8.

    * 'trailing-comma-tuple' check was added

      This message is emitted when pylint finds an one-element tuple,
      created by a stray comma. This can suggest a potential problem in the
      code and it is recommended to use parantheses in order to emphasise the
      creation of a tuple, rather than relying on the comma itself.

    * Don't emit not-callable for instances with unknown bases.

      Close #1213

    * Treat keyword only arguments the same as positional arguments with regard to unused-argument check

    * Don't try to access variables defined in a separate scope when checking for ``protected-access``

    * Added new check to detect incorrect usage of len(SEQUENCE) inside
      test conditions.

    * Added new extension to detect comparisons against empty string constants

    * Added new extension to detect comparisons of integers against zero

    * Added new error conditions for 'bad-super-call'

      Now detects ``super(type(self), self)`` and ``super(self.__class__, self)``
      which can lead to recursion loop in derived classes.

    * PyLinter.should_analyze_file has a new optional parameter, called `is_argument`

      Close #1079

    * Add attribute hints for missing members

      Closes #1035

    * Add a new warning, 'redefined-argument-from-local'

      Closes #649

    * Support inline comments for comma separated values in the config file

      Closes #1024

    * epylint.py_run's *script* parameter was removed.

    * epylint.py_run now uses ``shell=False`` for running the underlying process.

      Closes #441

    * Added a new warning, 'useless-super-delegation'

      Close 839.

    * Added a new error, 'invalid-metaclass', raised when
      we can detect that a class is using an improper metaclass.

      Close #579

    * Added a new refactoring message, 'literal-comparison'.

      Close #786

    * arguments-differ takes in consideration kwonlyargs and variadics

      Close #983

    * Removed --optimized-ast. Part of #975.

    * Removed --files-output option. Part of #975.

    * Removed pylint-gui from the package.

    * Removed the HTML reporter. Part of #975.

    * ignored-argument-names is now used for ignoring arguments for unused-variable check.

      This option was used for ignoring arguments when computing the correct number of arguments
      a function should have, but for handling the arguments with regard
      to unused-variable check, dummy-variables-rgx was used instead. Now, ignored-argument-names
      is used for its original purpose and also for ignoring the matched arguments for
      the unused-variable check. This offers a better control of what should be ignored
      and how.
      Also, the same option was moved from the design checker to the variables checker,
      which means that the option now appears under the ``[VARIABLES]`` section inside
      the configuration file.
      Close #862.

    * Fix a false positive for keyword variadics with regard to keyword only arguments.

      If a keyword only argument was necessary for a function, but that function was called
      with keyword variadics (**kwargs), then we were emitting a missing-kwoa false positive,
      which is now fixed.

      Close #934.

    * Fix some false positives with unknown sized variadics.

      Close #878

    * Added a new extension, check_docstring, for checking PEP 257 conventions.

      Closes #868.

    * config files with BOM markers can now be read.

      Close #864.

    * epylint.py_run does not crash on big files, using .communicate() instead of .wait()

      Close #599

    * Disable reports by default and show the evaluation score by default

      As per discussion from issue #746, the reports were disabled by
      default in order to simplify the interaction between the tool
      and the users. The score is still shown by default, as a way of
      closely measuring when it increases or decreases due to changes
      brought to the code.

    * Disable the information category messages by default.

      This is a step towards making pylint more sane, as
      per the discussion from issue #746.

    * Catch more cases as not proper iterables for __slots__ with
      regard to invalid-slots pattern. Closes issue #775.

    * empty indent strings are rejected.

    * Added a new error, 'relative-beyond-top-level', which is emitted
      when a relative import was attempted beyond the top level package.

      Closes issue #588.

    * Added a new warning, 'unsupported-assignment-operation', which is
      emitted when item assignment is tried on an object which doesn't
      have this ability. Closes issue #591.

    * Added a new warning, 'unsupported-delete-operation', which is
      emitted when item deletion is tried on an object which doesn't
      have this ability. Closes issue #592.

    * Fix a false positive of 'redundant-returns-doc', occurred when the documented
      function was using *yield* instead of *return*.

      Closes issue #984.

    * Fix false positives of 'missing-[raises|params|type]-doc' due to not
      recognizing keyword synonyms supported by Sphinx.

    * Added a new refactoring message, 'consider-merging-isinstance', which is
      emitted whenever we can detect that consecutive isinstance calls can be
      merged together.

      Closes issue #968

    * Fix a false positive of 'missing-param-doc' and 'missing-type-doc',
      occurred when a class docstring uses the 'For the parameters, see'
      magic string but the class __init__ docstring does not, or vice versa.

    * `redefined-outer-name` is now also emitted when a nested loop's target
      variable is the same as a target variable in an outer loop.

      Closes issue #911.

    * Added proper exception type inference for 'missing-raises-doc'.

    * Added InvalidMessageError exception class to replace asserts in
      pylint.utils.

    * More thorough validation in MessagesStore.register_messages() to avoid
      one message accidentally overwriting another.

    * InvalidMessageError, UnknownMessage, and EmptyReport exceptions are
      moved to the new pylint.exceptions submodule.

    * UnknownMessage and EmptyReport are renamed to UnknownMessageError and
      EmptyReportError.

    * Warnings 'missing-returns-type-doc' and 'missing-yields-type-doc'
      have each been split into two warnings - 'missing-[return|yield]-doc'
      and 'missing-[return|yield]-type-doc'.

    * Added epytext support to docparams extension.

      Closes #1029.

    * Support having plugins with the same name and with options defined

      Closes #1018

    * Sort configuration options in a section

      Closes #1087

    * Added a new Python 3 warning around implementing '__div__', '__idiv__', or
      '__rdiv__' as those methods are phased out in Python 3.

    * Added a new warning, 'overlapping-except', which is
      emitted when two exceptions in the same except-clause are aliases
      for each other or one exceptions is an ancestor of another.

    * Avoid crashing on ill-formatted strings when checking for string formatting errors.

    * Added a new Python 3 warning for calling 'str.encode' or 'str.decode' with a non-text
      encoding.

    * Added new coding convention message, 'single-string-used-for-slots'.

      Closes #1166

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing 'sys.maxint' which was removed in Python 3 in favor
      of 'sys.maxsize'

    * Added a new Python 3 check for bad imports.

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing deprecated string functions.

    * Do not warn about unused arguments or function being redefined in singledispatch
      registered implementations.

      Closes #1032 and #1034

    * Added refactoring message 'no-else-return'.

    * Improve unused-variable checker to warn about unused variables in module scope.

      Closes #919

    * Ignore modules import as _ when checking for unused imports.

      Closes #1190

    * Improve handing of Python 3 classes with metaclasses declared in nested scopes.

      Closes #1177

    * Added refactoring message 'consider-using-ternary'.

      Closes #1204

    * Bug-fix for false-positive logging-format-interpolation` when format specifications
      are used in formatted string.

      Fixes #572

    * Added a new switch ``single-line-class-stmt`` to allow single-line declaration
      of empty class bodies.

      Closes #738

    * Protected access in form `type(self)._attribute` are now allowed.

      Fixes #1031

    * Let the user modify msg-template when Pylint is called from a Python script

      Fixes #1269

    * Imports checker supports new switch ``allow-wildcard-with-all`` which disables
      warning on wildcard import when imported module defines `__all__` variable.

      Fixes #831

    * `too-many-format-args` and `too-few-format-args` are emitted correctly when
      starred expression are used in RHS tuple.

      Fixes #957

    * `cyclic-import` checker supports local disable clauses. When one
      of cycle imports was done in scope where disable clause was active,
      cycle is not reported as violation.

      Fixes #59


What's new in Pylint 1.6.3?
===========================

Release date: 2016-07-18

    * Do not crash when inferring uninferable exception types for docparams extension

      Close #998


What's new in Pylint 1.6.2?
===========================

Release date: TBA

    * Do not crash when printing the help of options with default regular expressions

      Close #990

    * More granular versions for deprecated modules.

      Close #991


What's new in Pylint 1.6.1?
===========================

Release date: 2016-07-07

    * Use environment markers for supporting conditional dependencies.


What's New in Pylint 1.6.0?
===========================

Release date: 2016-07-03

    * Added a new extension, `pylint.extensions.mccabe`, for warning
      about complexity in code.

    * Deprecate support for --optimize-ast. Part of #975.

    * Deprecate support for the HTML output. Part of #975.

    * Deprecate support for --output-files. Part of #975.

    * Fixed a documentation error for the check_docs extension. Fixes #735.

    * Made the list of property-defining decorators configurable.

    * Fix a bug where the top name of a qualified import was detected as unused variable.

      Close #923.

    * bad-builtin is now an extension check.

    * generated-members support qualified name through regular expressions.

      For instance, one can specify a regular expression as --generated-members=astroid.node_classes.*
      for ignoring every no-member error that is accessed as in `astroid.node_classes.missing.object`.

    * Add the ability to ignore files based on regex matching, with the new ``--ignore-patterns``
      option.

      This addresses issue #156 by allowing for multiple ignore patterns
      to be specified. Rather than clobber the existing ignore option, we
      introduced a new one called ignore-patterns.

    * Added a new error, 'trailing-newlines', which is emitted when a file
      has trailing new lines.

      Closes issue #682.

    * Add a new option, 'redefining-builtins-modules', for controlling the modules
      which can redefine builtins, such as six.moves and future.builtins.

      Close #464.

    * 'reimported' is emitted when the same name is imported from different module.

      Close #162.

    * Add a new recommendation checker, 'consider-iterating-dictionary', which is emitted
      which is emitted when a dictionary is iterated through .keys().

      Close #699

    * Use the configparser backport for Python 2

      This fixes a problem we were having with comments inside values, which is fixed
      in Python 3's configparser.
      Close #828

    * A new error was added, 'invalid-length-returned', when the `__len__`
      special method returned something else than a non-negative number.

      Close issue #557

    * Switch to using isort internally for wrong-import-order.

      Closes #879.

    * check_docs extension can find constructor parameters in __init__.

      Closes #887.

    * Don't warn about invalid-sequence-index if the indexed object has unknown base
      classes.

      Closes #867

    * Don't crash when checking, for super-init-not-called, a method defined in an if block.

    * Do not emit import-error or no-name-in-module for fallback import blocks by default.

      Until now, we warned with these errors when a fallback import block (a TryExcept block
      that contained imports for Python 2 and 3) was found, but this gets cumbersome when
      trying to write compatible code. As such, we don't check these blocks by default,
      but the analysis can be enforced by using the new ``--analyse-fallback-block`` flag.

      Close #769.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.5?
===========================

Release date: 2016-03-21


    * Let visit_importfrom from Python 3 porting checker be called when everything is disabled

      Because the visit method was filtering the patterns it was expecting to be activated,
      it didn't run when everything but one pattern was disabled, leading to spurious false
      positives

      Close #852

    * Don't emit unsubscriptable-value for classes with unknown
      base classes.

      Close #776.

    * Use an OrderedDict for storing the configuration elements

      This fixes an issue related to impredictible order of the disable / enable
      elements from a config file. In certain cases, the disable was coming before
      the enable which resulted in classes of errors to be enabled, even though the intention
      was to disable them. The best example for this was in the context of running multiple
      processes, each one of it having different enables / disables that affected the output.

      Close #815

    * Don't consider bare and broad except handlers as ignoring NameError,
      AttributeError and similar exceptions, in the context of checkers for
      these issues.

      Closes issue #826


What's New in Pylint 1.5.4?
===========================

Release date: 2016-01-15


    * Merge StringMethodChecker with StringFormatChecker. This fixes a
      bug where disabling all the messages and enabling only a handful of
      messages from the StringFormatChecker would have resulted in no
      messages at all.

    * Don't apply unneeded-not over sets.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.3?
===========================

Release date: 2016-01-11

    * Handle the import fallback idiom with regard to wrong-import-order.

      Closes issue #750.

    * Decouple the displaying of reports from the displaying of messages

      Some reporters are aggregating the messages instead of displaying
      them when they are available. The actual displaying was conflatted
      in the generate_reports. Unfortunately this behaviour was flaky
      and in the case of the JSON reporter, the messages weren't shown
      at all if a file had syntax errors or if it was missing.
      In order to fix this, the aggregated messages can now be
      displayed with Reporter.display_message, while the reports are
      displayed with display_reports.

      Closes issues #766 and #765.

    * Ignore function calls with variadic arguments without a context.

      Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments
      will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in
      some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter.
      In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context
      propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected.
      Closes issue #722.

    * Treat AsyncFunctionDef just like FunctionDef nodes,
      by implementing visit_asyncfunctiondef in terms of
      visit_functiondef.

      Closes issue #767.

    * Take in account kwonlyargs when verifying that arguments
      are defined with the check_docs extension.

      Closes issue #745.

    * Suppress reporting 'unneeded-not' inside `__ne__` methods

      Closes issue #749.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.2?
===========================

Release date: 2015-12-21

    * Don't crash if graphviz is not installed, instead emit a
      warning letting the user to know.

      Closes issue #168.

    * Accept only functions and methods for the deprecated-method checker.

      This prevents a crash which can occur when an object doesn't have
      .qname() method after the inference.

    * Don't emit super-on-old-class on classes with unknown bases.
      Closes issue #721.

    * Allow statements in `if` or `try` blocks containing imports.

      Closes issue #714.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.1?
===========================

Release date: 2015-12-02


    * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
      in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.

    * Add wrong-import-position to check_messages's decorator arguments
      for ImportChecker.leave_module
      This fixes an esoteric bug which occurs when ungrouped-imports and
      wrong-import-order are disabled and pylint is executed on multiple files.
      What happens is that without wrong-import-position in check_messages,
      leave_module will never be called, which means that the first non-import node
      from other files might leak into the current file,
      leading to wrong-import-position being emitted by pylint.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
      in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.

    * Don't emit import-self and cyclic-import for relative imports
      of modules with the same name as the package itself.
      Closes issues #708 and #706.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.0?
===========================

Release date: 2015-11-29


    * Added multiple warnings related to imports. 'wrong-import-order'
      is emitted when PEP 8 recommendations regarding imports are not
      respected (that is, standard imports should be followed by third-party
      imports and then by local imports). 'ungrouped-imports' is emitted
      when imports from the same package or module are not placed
      together, but scattered around in the code. 'wrong-import-position'
      is emitted when code is mixed with imports, being recommended for the
      latter to be at the top of the file, in order to figure out easier by
      a human reader what dependencies a module has.
      Closes issue #692.

    * Added a new refactoring warning, 'unneeded-not', emitted
      when an expression with the not operator could be simplified.
      Closes issue #670.

    * Added a new refactoring warning, 'simplifiable-if-statement',
      used when an if statement could be reduced to a boolean evaluation
      of its test. Closes issue #698.

    * Added a new refactoring warning, 'too-many-boolean-expressions',
      used when an if statement contains too many boolean expressions,
      which makes the code less maintainable and harder to understand.
      Closes issue #677.

    * Property methods are shown as attributes instead of functions in
      pyreverse class diagrams. Closes Issue #284

    * Add a new refactoring error, 'too-many-nested-blocks', which is emitted
      when a function or a method has too many nested blocks, which makes the
      code less readable and harder to understand. Closes issue #668.

    * Add a new error, 'unsubscriptable-object', that is emitted when
      value used in subscription expression doesn't support subscription
      (i.e. doesn't define __getitem__ method).

    * Don't warn about abstract classes instantiated in their own
      body. Closes issue #627.

    * Obsolete options are not present by default in the generated
      configuration file. Closes issue #632.

    * non-iterator-returned can detect classes with iterator-metaclasses.
      Closes issue #679.

    * Add a new error, 'unsupported-membership-test', emitted when value
      to the right of the 'in' operator doesn't support membership test
      protocol (i.e. doesn't define __contains__/__iter__/__getitem__)

    * Add new errors, 'not-an-iterable', emitted when non-iterable value
      is used in an iterating context (starargs, for-statement,
      comprehensions, etc), and 'not-a-mapping', emitted when non-mapping
      value is used in a mapping context. Closes issue #563.

    * Make 'no-self-use' checker not emit a warning if there is a 'super()'
      call inside the method.
      Closes issue #667.

    * Add checker to identify multiple imports on one line.
      Closes issue #598.

    * Fix unused-argument false positive when the "+=" operator is used.
      Closes issue #518.

    * Don't emit import-error for ignored modules. PyLint will not emit import
      errors for any import which is, or is a subpackage of, a module in
      the ignored-modules list. Closes issue #223.

    * Fix unused-import false positive when the import is used in a
      class assignment. Closes issue #475

    * Add a new error, 'not-context-manager', emitted when something
      that doesn't implement __enter__ and __exit__ is used in a with
      statement.

    * Add a new warning, 'confusing-with-statement', emitted by the
      base checker, when an ambiguous looking with statement is used.
      For example `with open() as first, second` which looks like a
      tuple assignment but is actually 2 context managers.

    * Add a new warning, 'duplicate-except', emitted when there is an
      exception handler which handles an exception type that was handled
      before. Closes issue #485.

    * A couple of warnings got promoted to errors, since they could uncover
      potential bugs in the code. These warnings are: assignment-from-none,
      unbalanced-tuple-unpacking, unpacking-non-sequence, non-iterator-returned.
      Closes issue #388.

    * Allow ending a pragma control with a semicolon. In this way, users
      can continue a pragma control with a reason for why it is used,
      as in `# pylint: disable=old-style-class;reason=...`.
      Closes issue #449.

    * --jobs can be used with --load-plugins now. Closes issue #456.

    * Improve the performance of --jobs when dealing only with a package
      name. Closes issue #479.

    * Don't emit an unused-wildcard-import when the imported name comes
      from another module and it is in fact a __future__ name.

    * The colorized reporter now works on Windows. Closes issue #96.

    * Remove pointless-except warning. It was previously disabled by
      default and it wasn't very useful. Closes issue #506.

    * Fix a crash on Python 3 related to the string checker, which
      crashed when it encountered a bytes string with a .format
      method called.

    * Don't warn about no-self-use for builtin properties.

    * Fix a false positive for bad-reversed-sequence, when a subclass
      of a `dict` provides a __reversed__ method.

    * Change the default no-docstring-rgx so missing-docstring isn't
      emitted for private functions.

    * Don't emit redefined-outer-name for __future__ directives.
      Closes issue #520.

    * Provide some hints for the bad-builtin message. Closes issue #522.

    * When checking for invalid arguments to a callable, in typecheck.py,
      look up for the __init__ in case the found __new__ comes from builtins.

      Since the __new__ comes from builtins, it will not have attached any
      information regarding what parameters it expects, so the check
      will be useless. Retrieving __init__ in that case will at least
      detect a couple of false negatives. Closes issue #429.

    * Don't emit no-member for classes with unknown bases.

      Since we don't know what those bases might add, we simply ignore
      the error in this case.

    * Lookup in the implicit metaclass when checking for no-member,
      if the class in question has an implicit metaclass, which is
      True for new style classes. Closes issue #438.

    * Add two new warnings, duplicate-bases and inconsistent-mro.

      duplicate-bases is emitted when a class has the same bases
      listed more than once in its bases definition, while inconsistent-mro
      is emitted when no sane mro hierarchy can be determined. Closes issue #526.

    * Remove interface-not-implemented warning. Closes issue #532.

    * Remove the rest of interface checks: interface-is-not-class,
      missing-interface-method, unresolved-interface. The reason is that
      its better to start recommending ABCs instead of the old Zope era
      of interfaces. One side effect of this change is that ignore-iface-methods
      becomes a noop, it's deprecated and it will be removed at some time.

    * Emit a proper deprecation warning for reporters.BaseReporter.add_message.

      The alternative way is to use handle_message. add_message will be removed in
      Pylint 1.6.

    * Added new module 'extensions' for optional checkers with the test
      directory 'test/extensions' and documentation file 'doc/extensions.rst'.

    * Added new checker 'extensions.check_docs' that verifies parameter
      documention in Sphinx, Google, and Numpy style.

    * Detect undefined variable cases, where the "definition" of an undefined
      variable was in del statement. Instead of emitting used-before-assignment,
      which is totally misleading, it now emits undefined-variable.
      Closes issue #528.

    * Don't emit attribute-defined-outside-init and access-member-before-definition
      for mixin classes. Actual errors can occur in mixin classes, but this is
      controlled by the ignore-mixin-members option. Closes issue #412.

    * Improve the detection of undefined variables and variables used before
      assignment for variables used as default arguments to function,
      where the variable was first defined in the class scope.
      Closes issue #342 and issue #404.

    * Add a new warning, 'unexpected-special-method-signature', which is emitted
      when a special method (dunder method) doesn't have the expected signature,
      which can lead to actual errors in the application code.
      Closes issue #253.

    * Remove 'bad-context-manager' due to the inclusion of 'unexpected-special-method-signature'.

    * Don't emit no-name-in-module if the import is guarded by an ImportError, Exception or
      a bare except clause.

    * Don't emit no-member if the attribute access node is protected by an
      except handler, which handles AttributeError, Exception or it is a
      bare except.

    * Don't emit import-error if the import is guarded by an ImportError, Exception or a
      bare except clause.

    * Don't emit undefined-variable if the node is guarded by a NameError, Exception
      or bare except clause.

    * Add a new warning, 'using-constant-test', which is emitted when a conditional
      statement (If, IfExp) uses a test which is always constant, such as numbers,
      classes, functions etc. This is most likely an error from the user's part.
      Closes issue #524.

    * Don't emit 'raising-non-exception' when the exception has unknown
      bases. We don't know what those bases actually are and it's better
      to assume that the user knows what he is doing rather than emitting
      a message which can be considered a false positive.

    * Look for a .pylintrc configuration file in the current folder,
      if pylintrc is not found. Dotted pylintrc files will not be searched
      in the parents of the current folder, as it is done for pylintrc.

    * Add a new error, 'invalid-unary-type-operand', emitted when
      an unary operand is used on something which doesn't support that
      operation (for instance, using the unary bitwise inversion operator
      on an instance which doesn't implement __invert__).

    * Take in consideration differences between arguments of various
      type of functions (classmethods, staticmethods, properties)
      when checking for `arguments-differ`. Closes issue #548.

    * astroid.inspector was moved to pylint.pyreverse, since it belongs
      there and it doesn't need to be in astroid.

    * astroid.utils.LocalsVisitor was moved to pylint.pyreverse.LocalsVisitor.

    * pylint.checkers.utils.excepts_import_error was removed.
      Use pylint.chekcers.utils.error_of_type instead.

    * Don't emit undefined-all-variables for nodes which can't be
      inferred (YES nodes).

    * yield-outside-func is also emitted for `yield from`.

    * Add a new error, 'too-many-star-expressions', emitted when
      there are more than one starred expression (`*x`) in an assignment.
      The warning is emitted only on Python 3.

    * Add a new error, 'invalid-star-assignment-target', emitted when
      a starred expression (`*x`) is used as the lhs side of an assignment,
      as in `*x = [1, 2]`. This is not a SyntaxError on Python 3 though.

    * Detect a couple of objects which can't be base classes (bool,
      slice, range and memoryview, which weren't detected until now).

    * Add a new error for the Python 3 porting checker, `import-star-module-level`,
      which is used when a star import is detected in another scope than the
      module level, which is an error on Python 3. Using this will emit a
      SyntaxWarning on Python 2.

    * Add a new error, 'star-needs-assignment-target', emitted on Python 3 when
      a Starred expression (`*x`) is not used in an assignment target. This is not
      caught when parsing the AST on Python 3, so it needs to be a separate check.

    * Add a new error, 'unsupported-binary-operation', emitted when
      two a binary arithmetic operation is executed between two objects
      which don't support it (a number plus a string for instance).
      This is currently disabled, since the it exhibits way too many false
      positives, but it will be reenabled as soon as possible.

    * New imported features from astroid into pyreverse: pyreverse.inspector.Project,
      pyreverse.inspector.project_from_files and pyreverse.inspector.interfaces.

      These were moved since they didn't belong in astroid.

    * Enable misplaced-future for Python 3. Closes issue #580.

    * Add a new error, 'nonlocal-and-global', which is emitted when a
      name is found to be both nonlocal and global in the same scope.
      Closes issue #581.

    * ignored-classes option can work with qualified names (ignored-classes=optparse.Values)
      Closes issue #297.

    * ignored-modules can work with qualified names as well as with Unix pattern
      matching for recursive ignoring. Closes issues #244.

    * Improve detection of relative imports in non-packages, as well as importing
      missing modules with a relative import from a package.

    * Don't emit no-init if not all the bases from a class are known.
      Closes issue #604.

    * --no-space-check option accepts `empty-line` as a possible option.
      Closes issue #541.

    * --generate-rcfile generates by default human readable symbols
      for the --disable option. Closes issue #608.

    * Improved the not-in-loop checker to properly detect more cases.

    * Add a new error, 'continue-in-finally', which is emitted when
      the `continue` keyword is found inside a `finally` clause, which
      is a SyntaxError.

    * The --zope flag is deprecated and it is slated for removal
      in Pylint 1.6.

      The reason behind this removal is the fact that it's a specialized
      flag and there are solutions for the original problem:
      use --generated-members with the members that causes problems
      when using Zope or add AST transforms tailored to the zope
      project.

      At the same time, --include-ids and --symbols will also be removed
      in Pylint 1.6. Closes issue #570.

    * missing-module-attribute was removed and the corresponding
      CLI option, required-attributes, which is slated for removal
      in Pylint 1.6.

    * missing-reversed-argument was removed.

      The reason behind this is that this kind of errors should be
      detected by the type checker for *all* the builtins and not
      as a special case for the reversed builtin. This will happen
      shortly in the future.

    * --comment flag is obsolete and it will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

    * --profile flag is obsolete and it will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

    * Add a new error, 'misplaced-bare-raise'.

      The error is used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause.
      This can generate a RuntimeError in Python, if there are no active exceptions
      to be reraised. While it works in Python 2 due to the fact that the exception
      leaks outside of the except block, it's nevertheless a behaviour that
      a user shouldn't depend upon, since it's not obvious to the reader of the code
      what exception will be raised and it will not be compatible with Python 3 anyhow.
      Closes issue #633.

    * Bring logilab-common's ureports into pylint.reporters.

      With this change, we moved away from depending on logilab-common,
      having in Pylint all the components that were used from logilab-common.
      The API should be considered an implementation detail and can change at
      some point in the future.
      Closes issue #621.

    * `reimported` is emitted for reimported objects on the same line.

      Closes issue #639.

    * Abbreviations of command line options are not supported anymore.

      Using abbreviations for CLI options was never considered to be
      a feature of pylint, this fact being only a side effect of using optparse.
      As this was the case, using --load-plugin or other abbreviation
      for --load-plugins never actually worked, while it also didn't raise
      an error. Closes issue #424.

    * Add a new error, 'nonlocal-without-binding'

      The error is emitted on Python 3 when a nonlocal name is not bound
      to any variable in the parents scopes. Closes issue #582.

    * 'deprecated-module' can be shown for modules which aren't
       available. Closes issue #362.

    * Don't consider a class abstract if its members can't
      be properly inferred.

      This fixes a false positive related to abstract-class-instantiated.
      Closes issue #648.

    * Add a new checker for the async features added by PEP 492.

    * Add a new error, 'yield-inside-async-function', emitted on
      Python 3.5 and upwards when the `yield` statement is found inside
      a new coroutine function (PEP 492).

    * Add a new error, 'not-async-context-manager', emitted when
      an async context manager block is used with an object which doesn't
      support this protocol (PEP 492).

    * Add a new convention warning, 'singleton-comparison', emitted when
      comparison to True, False or None is found.

    * Don't emit 'assigning-non-slot' for descriptors. Closes issue #652.

    * Add a new error, 'repeated-keyword', when a keyword argument is passed
      multiple times into a function call.

      This is similar with redundant-keyword-arg, but it's mildly different
      that it needs to be a separate error.

    * --enable=all can now be used. Closes issue #142.

    * Add a new convention message, 'misplaced-comparison-constant',
      emitted when a constant is placed in the left hand side of a comparison,
      as in '5 == func()'. This is also called Yoda condition, since the
      flow of code reminds of the Star Wars green character, conditions usually
      encountered in languages with variabile assignments in conditional
      statements.

    * Add a new convention message, 'consider-using-enumerate', which is
      emitted when code that uses `range` and `len` for iterating is encountered.
      Closes issue #684.

    * Added two new refactoring messages, 'no-classmethod-decorator' and
      'no-staticmethod-decorator', which are emitted when a static method or a class
      method is declared without using decorators syntax.

      Closes issue #675.



What's New in Pylint 1.4.3?
===========================

Release date: 2015-03-14


    * Remove three warnings: star-args, abstract-class-little-used,
      abstract-class-not-used. These warnings don't add any real value
      and they don't imply errors or problems in the code.

    * Added a new option for controlling the peephole optimizer in astroid.
      The option ``--optimize-ast`` will control the peephole optimizer,
      which is used to optimize a couple of AST subtrees. The current problem
      solved by the peephole optimizer is when multiple joined strings,
      with the addition operator, are encountered. If the numbers of such
      strings is high enough, Pylint will then fail with a maximum recursion
      depth exceeded error, due to its visitor architecture. The peephole
      just transforms such calls, if it can, into the final resulting string
      and this exhibit a problem, because the visit_binop method stops being
      called (in the optimized AST it will be a Const node).


What's New in Pylint 1.4.2?
===========================

Release date: 2015-03-11

    * Don't require a docstring for empty modules. Closes issue #261.

    * Fix a false positive with `too-few-format-args` string warning,
      emitted when the string format contained a normal positional
      argument ('{0}'), mixed with a positional argument which did
      an attribute access ('{0.__class__}').
      Closes issue #463.

    * Take in account all the methods from the ancestors
      when checking for too-few-public-methods. Closes issue #471.

    * Catch enchant errors and emit 'invalid-characters-in-docstring'
      when checking for spelling errors. Closes issue #469.

    * Use all the inferred statements for the super-init-not-called
      check. Closes issue #389.

    * Add a new warning, 'unichr-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the unichr builtin is found. Closes issue #472.

    * Add a new warning, 'intern-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the intern builtin is found. Closes issue #473.

    * Add support for editable installations.

    * The HTML output accepts the `--msg-template` option. Patch by
      Dan Goldsmith.

    * Add 'map-builtin-not-iterating' (replacing 'implicit-map-evaluation'),
      'zip-builtin-not-iterating', 'range-builtin-not-iterating', and
      'filter-builtin-not-iterating' which are emitted by `--py3k` when the
      appropriate built-in is not used in an iterating context (semantics
      taken from 2to3).

    * Add a new warning, 'unidiomatic-typecheck', emitted when an explicit
      typecheck uses type() instead of isinstance(). For example,
      `type(x) == Y` instead of `isinstance(x, Y)`. Patch by Chris Rebert.
      Closes issue #299.

    * Add support for combining the Python 3 checker mode with the --jobs
      flag (--py3k and --jobs). Closes issue #467.

    * Add a new warning for the Python 3 porting checker, 'using-cmp-argument',
      emitted when the `cmp` argument for the `list.sort` or `sorted builtin`
      is encountered.

    * Make the --py3k flag commutative with the -E flag. Also, this patch
      fixes the leaks of error messages from the Python 3 checker when
      the errors mode was activated. Closes issue #437.


What's New in Pylint 1.4.1?
===========================

Release date: 2015-01-16

    * Look only in the current function's scope for bad-super-call.
      Closes issue #403.

    * Check the return of properties when checking for not-callable.
      Closes issue #406.

    * Warn about using the input() or round() built-ins for Python 3.
      Closes issue #411.

    * Proper abstract method lookup while checking for
      abstract-class-instantiated. Closes issue #401.

    * Use a mro traversal for finding abstract methods. Closes issue #415.

    * Fix a false positive with catching-non-exception and tuples of
      exceptions.

    * Fix a false negative with raising-non-exception, when the raise used
      an uninferrable exception context.

    * Fix a false positive on Python 2 for raising-bad-type, when
      raising tuples in the form 'raise (ZeroDivisionError, None)'.

    * Fix a false positive with invalid-slots-objects, where the slot entry
      was a unicode string on Python 2. Closes issue #421.

    * Add a new warning, 'redundant-unittest-assert', emitted when using
      unittest's methods assertTrue and assertFalse with constant value
      as argument. Patch by Vlad Temian.

    * Add a new JSON reporter, usable through -f flag.

    * Add the method names for the 'signature-differs' and 'argument-differs'
      warnings. Closes issue #433.

    * Don't compile test files when installing.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when using multiple jobs and the files
      given as argument didn't exist at all.


What's New in Pylint 1.4.0?
============================

Release date: 2014-11-23


    * Added new options for controlling the loading of C extensions.
      By default, only C extensions from the stdlib will be loaded
      into the active Python interpreter for inspection, because they
      can run arbitrary code on import. The option
      `--extension-pkg-whitelist` can be used to specify modules
      or packages that are safe to load.

    * Change default max-line-length to 100 rather than 80

    * Drop BaseRawChecker class which were only there for backward
      compat for a while now

    * Don't try to analyze string formatting with objects coming from
      function arguments. Closes issue #373.

    * Port source code to be Python 2/3 compatible. This drops the
      need for 2to3, but does drop support for Python 2.5.

    * Each message now comes with a confidence level attached, and
      can be filtered base on this level. This allows to filter out
      all messages that were emitted even though an inference failure
      happened during checking.

    * Improved presenting unused-import message. Closes issue #293.

    * Add new checker for finding spelling errors. New messages:
      wrong-spelling-in-comment, wrong-spelling-in-docstring.
      New options: spelling-dict, spelling-ignore-words.

    * Add new '-j' option for running checks in sub-processes.

    * Added new checks for line endings if they are mixed (LF vs CRLF)
      or if they are not as expected. New messages: mixed-line-endings,
      unexpected-line-ending-format. New option: expected-line-ending-format.

    * 'dangerous-default-value' no longer evaluates the value of the arguments,
      which could result in long error messages or sensitive data being leaked.
