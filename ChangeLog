What's New in Pylint 2.12.1?
============================
Release date: 2021-11-25

* Require Python ``3.6.2`` to run pylint.

  Closes #5065


What's New in Pylint 2.12.0?
============================
Release date: 2021-11-24

* Upgrade astroid to 2.9.0

  Closes #4982

* Add ability to add ``end_line`` and ``end_column`` to the ``--msg-template`` option.
  With the standard ``TextReporter`` this will add the line and column number of the
  end of a node to the output of Pylint. If these numbers are unknown, they are represented
  by an empty string.

* Introduced primer tests and a configuration tests framework. The helper classes available in
  ``pylint/testutil/`` are still unstable and might be modified in the near future.

  Closes #4412 #5287

* Fix ``install graphiz`` message which isn't needed for puml output format.

* ``MessageTest`` of the unittest ``testutil`` now requires the ``confidence`` attribute
  to match the expected value. If none is provided it is set to ``UNDEFINED``.

* ``add_message`` of the unittest ``testutil`` now actually handles the ``col_offset`` parameter
  and allows it to be checked against actual output in a test.

* Fix a crash in the ``check_elif`` extensions where an undetected if in a comprehension
  with an if statement within a f-string resulted in an out of range error. The checker no
  longer relies on counting if statements anymore and uses known if statements locations instead.
  It should not crash on badly parsed if statements anymore.

* Fix ``simplify-boolean-expression`` when condition can be inferred as False.

  Closes #5200

* Fix exception when pyreverse parses ``property function`` of a class.

* The functional ``testutils`` now accept ``end_lineno`` and ``end_column``. Expected
  output files without these will trigger a ``DeprecationWarning``. Expected output files
  can be easily updated with the ``python tests/test_functional.py --update-functional-output`` command.

* The functional ``testutils`` now correctly check the distinction betweeen ``HIGH`` and
  ``UNDEFINED`` confidence. Expected output files without defiend ``confidence`` levels will now
  trigger a ``DeprecationWarning``. Expected output files can be easily updated with the
  ``python tests/test_functional.py --update-functional-output`` command.

* The functional test runner now supports the option ``min_pyver_end_position`` to control on which python
  versions the ``end_lineno`` and ``end_column`` attributes should be checked. The default value is 3.8.

* Fix ``accept-no-yields-doc`` and ``accept-no-return-doc`` not allowing missing ``yield`` or
  ``return`` documentation when a docstring is partially correct

  Closes #5223

* Add an optional extension ``consider-using-any-or-all`` : Emitted when a ``for`` loop only
  produces a boolean and could be replaced by ``any`` or ``all`` using a generator. Also suggests
  a suitable any or all statement.

  Closes #5008

* Properly identify parameters with no documentation and add new message called ``missing-any-param-doc``

  Closes #3799
* Add checkers ``overridden-final-method`` & ``subclassed-final-class``

  Closes #3197

* Fixed ``protected-access`` for accessing of attributes and methods of inner classes

  Closes #3066

* Added support for ``ModuleNotFoundError`` (``import-error`` and ``no-name-in-module``).
  ``ModuleNotFoundError`` inherits from ``ImportError`` and was added in Python ``3.6``

* ``undefined-variable`` now correctly flags variables which only receive a type annotations
  and never get assigned a value

  Closes #5140

* ``undefined-variable`` now correctly considers the line numbering and order of classes
  used in metaclass declarations

  Closes #4031

* ``used-before-assignment`` now correctly considers references to classes as type annotation
  or default values in first-level methods

  Closes #3771

* ``undefined-variable`` and ``unused-variable`` now correctly trigger for assignment expressions
  in functions defaults

  Fixes part of #3688

* ``undefined-variable`` now correctly triggers for assignment expressions in if ... else statements
  This includes a basic form of control flow inference for if ... else statements using
  constant boolean values

  Closes #3688

* Added the ``--enable-all-extensions`` command line option. It will load all available extensions
  which can be listed by running ``--list-extensions``

* Fix bug with importing namespace packages with relative imports

  Closes #2967 and #5131

* Improve and flatten ``unused-wildcard-import`` message

  Closes #3859

* In length checker, ``len-as-condition`` has been renamed as
  ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-len`` in order to be consistent with
  ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison``.

* Created new ``UnsupportedVersionChecker`` checker class that includes checks for features
  not supported by all versions indicated by a ``py-version``.

  * Added ``using-f-string-in-unsupported-version`` checker. Issued when ``py-version``
    is set to a version that does not support f-strings (< 3.6)

* Fix ``useless-super-delegation`` false positive when default keyword argument is a variable.

* Properly emit ``duplicate-key`` when Enum members are duplicate dictionary keys

  Closes #5150

* Use ``py-version`` setting for alternative union syntax check (PEP 604),
  instead of the Python interpreter version.

* Subclasses of ``dict`` are regarded as reversible by the ``bad-reversed-sequence`` checker
  (Python 3.8 onwards).

  Closes #4981

* Support configuring mixin class pattern via ``mixin-class-rgx``

* Added new checker ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison``: Emitted when
  collection literal comparison is being used to check for emptiness.

  Closes #4774

* ``mising-param-doc`` now correctly parses asterisks for variable length and
  keyword parameters

  Closes #3733

* ``mising-param-doc`` now correctly handles Numpy parameter documentation without
  explicit typing

  Closes #5222

* ``pylint`` no longer crashes when checking assignment expressions within if-statements

  Closes #5178

* Update ``literal-comparison``` checker to ignore tuple literals

  Closes #3031

* Normalize the input to the ``ignore-paths`` option to allow both Posix and
  Windows paths

  Closes #5194

* Fix double emitting of ``not-callable`` on inferrable ``properties``

  Closes #4426

* ``self-cls-assignment`` now also considers tuple assignment

* Fix ``missing-function-docstring`` not being able to check ``__init__`` and other
  magic methods even if the ``no-docstring-rgx`` setting was set to do so

* Added ``using-final-decorator-in-unsupported-version`` checker. Issued when ``py-version``
  is set to a version that does not support ``typing.final`` (< 3.8)

* Added configuration option ``exclude-too-few-public-methods`` to allow excluding
  classes from the ``min-public-methods`` checker.

  Closes #3370

* The ``--jobs`` parameter now fallbacks to 1 if the host operating system does not
  have functioning shared semaphore implementation.

  Closes #5216

* Fix crash for ``unused-private-member`` when checking private members on ``__class__``

  Closes #5261

* Crashes when a list is encountered in a toml configuration do not happen anymore.

  Closes #4580

* Moved ``misplaced-comparison-constant`` to its own extension ``comparison_placement``.
  This checker was opinionated and now no longer a default. It can be reactived by adding
  ``pylint.extensions.comparison_placement`` to ``load-plugins`` in your config.

  Closes #1064

* A new ``bad-configuration-section`` checker was added that will emit for misplaced option
  in pylint's top level namespace for toml configuration. Top-level dictionaries or option defined
  in the wrong section will still silently not be taken into account, which is tracked in a
  follow-up issue.

  Follow-up in #5259

* Fix crash for ``protected-access`` on (outer) class traversal

* Added new checker ``useless-with-lock`` to find incorrect usage of with statement and threading module locks.
  Emitted when ``with threading.Lock():`` is used instead of ``with lock_instance:``.

  Closes #5208

* Make yn validator case insensitive, to allow for ``True`` and ``False`` in config files.

* Fix crash on ``open()`` calls when the ``mode`` argument is not a simple string.

  Partially closes #5321

* Pyreverse - Add the project root directory to sys.path

  Closes #2479

  allows using the latest ``ast`` parser.

* All standard jobs in the ``pylint`` CI now run on ``Python`` 3.8 by default. We still
  support python 3.6 and 3.7 and run tests for those interpreters.

* ``TypingChecker``

  * Fix false-negative for ``deprecated-typing-alias`` and ``consider-using-alias``
    with ``typing.Type`` + ``typing.Callable``.

* ``logging-format-interpolation`` and ``logging-not-lazy``, now works on logger
  class created from renamed logging import following an upgrade in astroid.

* Fix false-positive ``no-member`` with generic base class

  Closes PyCQA/astroid#942

* Fix ``assigning-non-slot`` false-positive with base that inherits from ``typing.Generic``

  Closes #4509
  Closes PyCQA/astroid#999

* New checker ``invalid-all-format``. Emitted when ``__all__`` has an invalid format,
  i.e. isn't a ``tuple`` or ``list``.

* Fix false positive ``unused-variable`` and ``undefined-variable`` with
  Pattern Matching in Python 3.10

* New checker ``await-outside-async``. Emitted when await is used outside an async function.

* Clarify documentation for ``typing`` extension.

  Closes #4545

* Add new extension ``CodeStyleChecker``. It includes checkers that can improve code
  consistency. As such they don't necessarily provide a performance benefit
  and are often times opinionated.

* New checker ``consider-using-tuple``. Emitted when an in-place defined
  list or set can be replaced by a tuple.

* New checker ``consider-using-namedtuple-or-dataclass``. Emitted when dictionary values
  can be replaced by namedtuples or dataclass instances.

* Fix error that occurred when using ``slice`` as subscript for dict.

* Reduce false-positives around inference of ``.value`` and ``.name``
  properties on ``Enum`` subclasses, following an upgrade in astroid

  Closes #1932
  Closes #2062

Release date: 2021-04-26

* Keep ``__pkginfo__.numversion`` a tuple to avoid breaking pylint-django.

  Closes #4405

* scm_setuptools has been added to the packaging.

* Pylint's tags are now the standard form ``vX.Y.Z`` and not ``pylint-X.Y.Z`` anymore.

* New warning message ``deprecated-class``. This message is emitted if import or call deprecated class of the
  standard library (like ``collections.Iterable`` that will be removed in Python 3.10).

Closes #4388


What's New in Pylint 2.8.1?
===========================
Release date: 2021-04-25

* Add numversion back (temporarily) in ``__pkginfo__`` because it broke Pylama and revert the unnecessary
  ``pylint.version`` breaking change.

  Closes #4399


What's New in Pylint 2.8.0?
===========================
Release date: 2021-04-24

* New refactoring message ``consider-using-with``. This message is emitted if resource-allocating functions or methods of the
  standard library (like ``open()`` or ``threading.Lock.acquire()``) that can be used as a context manager are called without
  a ``with`` block.

  Closes #3413

* Resolve false positives on unused variables in decorator functions

  Closes #4252

* Add new extension ``ConfusingConsecutiveElifChecker``. This optional checker emits a refactoring message (R5601 ``confusing-consecutive-elif``)
  if if/elif statements with different indentation levels follow directly one after the other.

* New option ``--output=<file>`` to output result to a file rather than printing to stdout.

  Closes #1070

* Use a prescriptive message for ``unidiomatic-typecheck``

  Closes #3891

* Apply ``const-naming-style`` to module constants annotated with
  ``typing.Final``

* The packaging is now done via setuptools exclusively. ``doc``, ``tests``, ``man``, ``elisp`` and ``Changelog`` are
  not packaged anymore - reducing the size of the package by 75%.

* Debian packaging is now  (officially) done in https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/packages/pylint.

* The 'doc' extra-require has been removed.

* ``__pkginfo__`` now only contain ``__version__`` (also accessible with ``pylint.__version__``), other meta-information are still
  accessible with ``from importlib import metadata;metadata.metadata('pylint')``.

* COPYING has been renamed to LICENSE for standardization.

* Fix false-positive ``used-before-assignment`` in function returns.

  Closes #4301

* Updated ``astroid`` to 2.5.3

  Closes #2822, #4206, #4284

  Closes #3406

* Don't auto-enable postponed evaluation of type annotations with Python 3.10

* Update ``astroid`` to 2.5.4

* Add new extension ``TypingChecker``. This optional checker can detect the use of deprecated typing aliases
  and can suggest the use of the alternative union syntax where possible.
  (For example, 'typing.Dict' can be replaced by 'dict', and 'typing.Unions' by '|', etc.)
  Make sure to check the config options if you plan on using it!

* Reactivates old counts in report mode.

  Closes #3819

* During detection of ``inconsistent-return-statements`` consider that ``assert False`` is a return node.

  Closes #4019

* Run will not fail if score exactly equals ``config.fail_under``.

* Functions that never returns may declare ``NoReturn`` as type hints, so that
  ``inconsistent-return-statements`` is not emitted.

  Closes #4122, #4188

* Improved protected access checks to allow access inside class methods

  Closes #1159

* Fix issue with PEP 585 syntax and the use of ``collections.abc.Set``

* Fix issue that caused class variables annotated with ``typing.ClassVar`` to be
  identified as class constants. Now, class variables annotated with
  ``typing.Final`` are identified as such.

  Closes #4277

* Continuous integration with read the doc has been added.

  Closes #3850

* Don't show ``DuplicateBasesError`` for attribute access

* Introduce logic for checking deprecated attributes in DeprecationMixin.

* Reduce usage of blacklist/whitelist terminology. Notably, ``extension-pkg-allow-list`` is an

  ``disallowed-name``. The previous names are accepted to maintain backward compatibility.

* Move deprecated checker to ``DeprecatedMixin``

  Closes #4086

* Bump ``astroid`` version to ``2.5.2``

  Close #3811

* ``inconsistent-return-statements`` message is now emitted if one of ``try/except`` statement
  is not returning explicitly while the other do.

  Closes #3468

  Close #3735

* ``len-as-conditions`` is now triggered only for classes that are inheriting directly from list, dict, or set and not implementing the ``__bool__`` function, or from generators like range or list/dict/set comprehension. This should reduce the false positives for other classes, like pandas's DataFrame or numpy's Array.

  Close #1879

* Fixes duplicate-errors not working with -j2+

  Close #3314

* ``generated-members`` now matches the qualified name of members

  Close #3407

* Changed setup.py to work with `distlib <https://pypi.org/project/distlib>`_

  Close #3555

* New check: ``consider-using-generator``

  This check warns when a comprehension is used inside an ``any`` or ``all`` function,
  since it is unnecessary and should be replaced by a generator instead.
  Using a generator would be less code and way faster.

  Close #3165

* Add Github Actions to replace Travis and AppVeyor in the future


What's New in Pylint 2.6.1?
===========================
Release date: 2021-02-16

* Astroid version has been set as < 2.5

  Close #4093


What's New in Pylint 2.6.0?
===========================
Release date: 2020-08-20

* Fix various scope-related bugs in ``undefined-variable`` checker

  Close #1082, #3434, #3461

* bad-continuation and bad-whitespace have been removed, black or another formatter can help you with this better than Pylint

  Close #246, #289, #638, #747, #1148, #1179, #1943, #2041, #2301, #2304, #2944, #3565

* The no-space-check option has been removed. It's no longer possible to consider empty line like a ``trailing-whitespace`` by using clever options

  Close #1368

* ``missing-kwoa`` is no longer emitted when dealing with overload functions

  Close #3655

* mixed-indentation has been removed, it is no longer useful since TabError is included directly in python3

  Close #3383

* Fix ``fail-under`` not accepting floats

* Fix a bug with ``ignore-docstrings`` ignoring all lines in a module

* Fix ``pre-commit`` config that could lead to undetected duplicate lines of code

* Fix a crash in parallel mode when the module's filepath is not set

  Close #3564

* Add ``raise-missing-from`` check for exceptions that should have a cause.

* Support both isort 4 and isort 5. If you have pinned isort 4 in your projet requirements, nothing changes. If you use isort 5, though, note that the ``known-standard-library`` option is not interpreted the same in isort 4 and isort 5 (see the migration guide in isort documentation for further details). For compatibility's sake for most pylint users, the ``known-standard-library`` option in pylint now maps to ``extra-standard-library`` in isort 5. If you really want what ``known-standard-library`` now means in isort 5, you must disable the ``wrong-import-order`` check in pylint and run isort manually with a proper isort configuration file.

  Close #3722

* Fix a crash caused by not guarding against ``InferenceError`` when calling ``infer_call_result``

  Close #3690

* Fix a crash in parallel mode when the module's filepath is not set

  Close #3564

  Close #3600

* ``continue-in-finally`` no longer emitted on Python 3.8 where it's now valid

  Close #3612

* Fix a regression where messages with dash are not fully parsed

  Close #3604

* In a TOML configuration file, it's now possible to use rich (non-string) types, such as list, integer or boolean instead of strings. For example, one can now define a *list* of message identifiers to enable like this::

    enable = [
        "use-symbolic-message-instead",
        "useless-suppression",
    ]

  Close #3538

* Fix a regression where the score was not reported with multiple jobs

  Close #3547

* Protect against ``AttributeError`` when checking ``cell-var-from-loop``

  Close #3646


What's New in Pylint 2.5.2?

  Close #3563

* Allow package files to be properly discovered with multiple jobs

  Close #3524

* Allow linting directories without ``__init__.py`` which was a regression in 2.5.

  Close #3528


What's New in Pylint 2.5.0?
===========================
Release date: 2020-04-27

* Fix a false negative for ``undefined-variable`` when using class attribute in comprehension.

  Close #3494

* Fix a false positive for ``undefined-variable`` when using class attribute in decorator or as type hint.

  Close #511
  Close #1976

* Remove HTML quoting of messages in JSON output.

  Close #2769

* Adjust the ``invalid-name`` rule to work with non-ASCII identifiers and add the ``non-ascii-name`` rule.

  Close #2725

* Positional-only arguments are taken in account for ``useless-super-delegation``

* ``unidiomatic-typecheck`` is no longer emitted for ``in`` and ``not in`` operators

  Close #3337

  Close #2874

* ``function-redefined`` exempts function redefined on a condition.

  Close #2410

* ``typing.overload`` functions are exempted from docstring checks

  Close #3350

* Emit ``invalid-overridden-method`` for improper async def overrides.

  Close #3355

* Do not allow ``python -m pylint ...`` to import user code

  ``python -m pylint ...`` adds the current working directory as the first element
  of ``sys.path``. This opens up a potential security hole where ``pylint`` will import
  user level code as long as that code resides in modules having the same name as stdlib
  or pylint's own modules.

  Close #3386

* Add ``dummy-variables-rgx`` option for ``_redeclared-assigned-name`` check.

  Close #3341

* Fixed graph creation for relative paths

* Add a check for asserts on string literals.

  Close #3284

* ``not in`` is considered iterating context for some of the Python 3 porting checkers.

* A new check ``inconsistent-quotes`` was added.

* Add a check for non string assignment to __name__ attribute.

  Close #583

* ``__pow__``, ``__imatmul__``, ``__trunc__``, ``__floor__``, and ``__ceil__`` are recognized as special method names.

  Close #3281

* Added errors for protocol functions when invalid return types are detected.
  E0304 (invalid-bool-returned): __bool__ did not return a bool
  E0305 (invalid-index-returned): __index__ did not return an integer
  E0306 (invalid-repr-returned): __repr__ did not return a string
  E0307 (invalid-str-returned): __str__ did not return a string

  E0312 (invalid-getnewargs-returned): __getnewargs__ did not return a tuple
  E0313 (invalid-getnewargs-ex-returned): __getnewargs_ex__ did not return a tuple of the form (tuple, dict)

  Close #560

* ``missing-*-docstring`` can look for ``__doc__`` assignments.

  Close #3301

* ``undefined-variable`` can now find undefined loop iterables

  Close #498

* ``safe_infer`` can infer a value as long as all the paths share the same type.

  Close #2503

* Add a --fail-under <score> flag, also configurable in a .pylintrc file. If the final score is more than the specified score, it's considered a success and pylint exits with exitcode 0. Otherwise, it's considered a failure and pylint exits with its current exitcode based on the messages issued.

  Close #2242

* Don't emit ``line-too-long`` for multilines when ``disable=line-too-long`` comment stands at their end

  Close #2957

* Fixed an ``AttributeError`` caused by improper handling of ``dataclasses`` inference in ``pyreverse``

  Close #3256

* Do not exempt bare except from ``undefined-variable`` and similar checks

  If a node was wrapped in a ``TryExcept``, ``pylint`` was taking a hint
  from the except handler when deciding to emit or not a message.
  We were treating bare except as a fully fledged ignore but only
  the corresponding exceptions should be handled that way (e.g. ``NameError`` or ``ImportError``)

  Close #3235

* No longer emit ``assignment-from-no-return`` when a function only raises an exception

  Close #3218

* Allow import aliases to exempt ``import-error`` when used in type annotations.

  Close #3178

* ``Ellipsis` is exempted from ``multiple-statements`` for function overloads.

  Close #3224

* No longer emit ``invalid-name`` for non-constants found at module level.

  Pylint was taking the following statement from PEP-8 too far, considering
  all module level variables as constants, which is not what the statement is saying:

  `Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in
  all capital letters with underscores separating words.`

  Close #3111
  Close #3132

* Allow ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` to be emitted for string juxtaposition

  Close #3030

* ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` was renamed ``implicit-str-concat``

* The ``json`` reporter no longer bypasses ``redirect_stdout``. Close #3227

* Move ``NoFileError``, ``OutputLine``, ``FunctionalTestReporter``,
  ``FunctionalTestFile``, ``LintModuleTest`` and related methods from
  ``test_functional.py`` to ``pylint.testutils`` to help testing for 3rd
  party pylint plugins.

* Can read config from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file.

  Close #617

* Fix exception-escape false positive with generators

  Close #3128

* ``inspect.getargvalues`` is no longer marked as deprecated.

* A new check ``f-string-without-interpolation`` was added

  Close #3190

* Flag mutable ``collections.*`` utilities as dangerous defaults

  Close #3183

* ``docparams`` extension supports multiple types in raises sections.

  Multiple types can also be separated by commas in all valid sections.

  Closes #2729

* Allow parallel linting when run under Prospector

* Fixed false positives of ``method-hidden`` when a subclass defines the method that is being hidden.

  Closes #414

* Python 3 porting mode is 30-50% faster on most codebases

* Python 3 porting mode no longer swallows syntax errors

  Closes #2956

* Pass the actual PyLinter object to sub processes to allow using custom
  PyLinter classes.

  PyLinter object (and all its members except reporter) needs to support
  pickling so the PyLinter object can be passed to worker processes.

* Clean up setup.py

  Make pytest-runner a requirement only if running tests, similar to McCabe.

  Clean up the setup.py file, resolving a number of warnings around it.

* Handle SyntaxError in files passed via ``--from-stdin`` option

  Pylint no longer outputs a traceback, if a file, read from stdin,
  contains a syntaxerror.

* Fix uppercase style to disallow 3+ uppercase followed by lowercase.

* Fixed ``undefined-variable`` and ``unused-import`` false positives
  when using a metaclass via an attribute.

  Close #1603

* Emit ``unused-argument`` for functions that partially uses their argument list before raising an exception.

  Close #3246

* Fixed ``broad_try_clause`` extension to check try/finally statements and to
  check for nested statements (e.g., inside of an ``if`` statement).

* Recognize classes explicitly inheriting from ``abc.ABC`` or having an
  ``abc.ABCMeta`` metaclass as abstract. This makes them not trigger W0223.

  Closes #3098

* Fix overzealous ``arguments-differ`` when overridden function uses variadics

  No message is emitted if the overriding function provides positional or
  keyword variadics in its signature that can feasibly accept and pass on
  all parameters given by the overridden function.

  Close #1482
  Close #1553

* Multiple types of string formatting are allowed in logging functions.

  The ``logging-fstring-interpolation`` message has been brought back to allow
  multiple types of string formatting to be used.

  Close #3361


What's New in Pylint 2.4.4?
===========================
Release date: 2019-11-13

* Exempt all the names found in type annotations from ``unused-import``

  The previous code was assuming that only ``typing`` names need to be
  exempted, but we need to do that for the rest of the type comment
  names as well.

  Close #3112

* Relax type import detection for names that do not come from the ``typing`` module

  Close #3191


What's New in Pylint 2.4.3?
===========================
Release date: 2019-10-18

* Fix an issue with ``unnecessary-comprehension`` in comprehensions with additional repacking of elements.

  Close #3148

* ``import-outside-toplevel`` is emitted for ``ImportFrom`` nodes as well.

  Close #3175

* Do not emit ``no-method-argument`` for functions using positional only args.

  Close #3161

* ``consider-using-sys-exit`` is no longer emitted when ``exit`` is imported in the local scope.

  Close #3147

* ``invalid-overridden-method`` takes ``abc.abstractproperty`` in account

  Close #3150

* Fixed ``missing-yield-type-doc`` getting incorrectly raised when
  a generator does not document a yield type but has a type annotation.

  Closes #3185

* ``typing.overload`` functions are exempted from ``too-many-function-args``

  Close #3170


What's New in Pylint 2.4.2?
===========================
Release date: 2019-09-30


* ``ignored-modules`` can skip submodules. Close #3135

* ``self-assigning-variable`` skips class level assignments.

   Close #2930

* ``consider-using-sys-exit`` is exempted when ``exit()`` is imported from ``sys``

   Close #3145

* Exempt annotated assignments without variable from ``class-variable-slots-conflict``

  Close #3141

* Fix ``utils.is_error`` to account for functions returning early.

  This fixes a false negative with ``unused-variable`` which was no longer triggered
  when a function raised an exception as the last instruction, but the body of the function
  still had unused variables.

  Close #3028


What's New in Pylint 2.4.1?
===========================
Release date: 2019-09-25


* Exempt type checking definitions defined in both clauses of a type checking guard

  Close #3127


* Exempt type checking definitions inside the type check guard

  In a7f236528bb3758886b97285a56f3f9ce5b13a99 we added basic support
  for emitting ``used-before-assignment`` if a variable was only defined
  inside a type checking guard (using ``TYPE_CHECKING`` variable from `typing`)
  Unfortunately that missed the case of using those type checking imports
  inside the guard itself, which triggered spurious used-before-assignment errors.

  Close #3119

* Require astroid >= 2.3 to avoid any compatibility issues.


What's New in Pylint 2.4.0?
===========================
Release date: 2019-09-24

* New check: ``import-outside-toplevel``

  This check warns when modules are imported from places other than a
  module toplevel, e.g. inside a function or a class.

* Handle inference ambiguity for ``invalid-format-index``

  Close #2752

* Removed Python 2 specific checks such as ``relative-import``,
  ``invalid-encoded-data``, ``missing-super-argument``.

* Support forward references for ``function-redefined`` check.

  Close #2540

* Handle redefinitions in case of type checking imports.

  Close #2834

* Added a new check, ``consider-using-sys-exit``

  This check is emitted when we detect that a quit() or exit() is invoked
  instead of sys.exit(), which is the preferred way of exiting in program.

  Close #2925

* ``useless-suppression`` check now ignores ``cyclic-import`` suppressions,
  which could lead to false postiives due to incomplete context at the time
  of the check.

  Close #3064

* Added new checks, ``no-else-break`` and ``no-else-continue``

  These checks highlight unnecessary ``else`` and ``elif`` blocks after
  ``break`` and ``continue`` statements.

  Close #2327

* Don't emit ``protected-access`` when a single underscore prefixed attribute
  is used inside a special method

  Close #1802

* Fix the "statement" values in the PyLinter's stats reports by module.

* Added a new check, ``invalid-overridden-method``

  This check is emitted when we detect that a method is overridden
  as a property or a property is overridden as a method. This can indicate
  a bug in the application code that will trigger a runtime error.

  Close #2670

* Added a new check, ``arguments-out-of-order``

  This check warns if you have arguments with names that match those in
  a function's signature but you are passing them in to the function
  in a different order.

  Close #2975

* Added a new check, ``redeclared-assigned-name``

  This check is emitted when ``pylint`` detects that a name
  was assigned one or multiple times in the same assignment,
  which indicate a potential bug.
  Close #2898

* Ignore lambda calls with variadic arguments without a context.

  Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments
  will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in
  some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter.
  In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context
  propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected.
  We already did that for function calls, but the previous fix
  was not taking in consideration ``lambdas``

  Close #2918

* Added a new check, ``self-assigning-variable``

  This check is emitted when we detect that a variable is assigned
  to itself, which might indicate a potential bug in the code application.
  Close #2930

* Added a new check, ``property-with-parameters``.

  This check is emitted when we detect that a defined property also
  has parameters, which are useless.
  Close #3006

* Excluded protocol classes from a couple of checks. Close #3002.

* Add a check ``unnecessary-comprehension`` that detects unnecessary comprehensions.

  This check is emitted when ``pylint`` finds list-, set- or dict-comprehensions,
  that are unnecessary and can be rewritten with the list-, set- or dict-constructors.

  Close #2905

* Excluded PEP 526 instance and class variables from ``no-member``. Close #2945

* Excluded ``attrs`` from ``too-few-public-methods`` check. Close #2988.

* ``unused-import`` emitted for the right import names in function scopes.

  Close #2928

* Dropped support for Python 3.4.

* ``assignment-from-no-return`` not triggered for async methods.

  Close #2902

* Don't emit ``attribute-defined-outside-init`` for variables defined in setters.

  Close #409

* Syntax errors report the column number.

  Close #2914

* Support fully qualified typing imports for type annotations.

  Close #2915

* Exclude ``__dict__`` from ``attribute-defined-outside-init``

* Fix pointer on spelling check when the error are more than one time in the same line.

  Close #2895

* Fix crash happening when parent of called object cannot be determined

* Allow of in ``GoogleDocstring.re_multiple_type``

* Added ``subprocess-run-check`` to handle subrocess.run without explicitly set ``check`` keyword.

  Close #2848

* When we can't infer bare except handlers, skip ``try-except-raise``

  Close #2853

* Handle more ``unnecessary-lambda`` cases when dealing with additional kwargs in wrapped calls

  Close #2845

* Better postponed evaluation of annotations handling

  Close #2847

* Support postponed evaluation of annotations for variable annotations.

  Close #2838

* ``epylint.py_run`` defaults to ``python`` in case the current executable is not a Python one.

  Close #2837

* Ignore raw docstrings when running Similarities checker with ``ignore-docstrings=yes`` option

* Fix crash when calling ``inherit_from_std_ex`` on a class which is its own ancestor

  Close #2680

* Added a new check that warns the user if a function call is used inside a test but parentheses are missing.

  Close #2658

* ``len-as-condition`` now only fires when a ``len(x)`` call is made without an explicit comparison

  The message and description accompanying this checker has been changed
  reflect this new behavior, by explicitly asking to either rely on the
  fact that empty sequence are false or to compare the length with a scalar.

  Close #2684

* Add ``preferred-module`` checker that notify if an import has a replacement module that should be used.

  This check is emitted when ``pylint`` finds an imported module that has a
  preferred replacement listed in ``preferred-modules``.

* ``assigning-non-slot`` not emitted for classes with unknown base classes.

  Close #2807

* ``old-division`` is not emitted for non-Const nodes.

  Close #2808

* Added method arguments to the dot writer for pyreverse.

  Close #2139

* Support for linting file from stdin.

  IDEs may benefit from the support for linting from an in-memory file.

  Close #1187

* Added a new check ``class-variable-slots-conflict``

  This check is emitted when ``pylint`` finds a class variable that conflicts with a slot
  name, which would raise a ``ValueError`` at runtime.

* Added new check: dict-iter-missing-items (E1141)

  Close #2761

* Fix issue with pylint name in output of python -m pylint --version

  Close #2764

* Relicense logo material under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

* Skip ``if`` expressions from f-strings for the ``check_elif`` checker

  Close #2816

* C0412 (ungrouped-import) is now compatible with isort.

  Close #2806

* Added new extension to detect too much code in a try clause

  Close #2877

* ``signature-mutators`` option was added

   With this option, users can choose to ignore ``too-many-function-args``, ``unexpected-keyword-arg``,
   and ``no-value-for-parameter`` for functions decorated with decorators that change
   the signature of a decorated function.

   Close #259

* Fixed a pragma comment on its own physical line being ignored when part
  of a logical line with the previous physical line.

  Close #199

* Fixed false ``undefined-loop-variable`` for a function defined in the loop,
  that uses the variable defined in that loop.

  Close #202

* Fixed ``unused-argument`` and ``function-redefined`` getting raised for
  functions decorated with ``typing.overload``.

  Close #1581

* Fixed a false positive with ``consider-using-dict-comprehension`` for constructions that can't be converted to a comprehension

  Close #2963

* Added ``__post_init__`` to ``defining-attr-methods`` in order to avoid ``attribute-defined-outside-init`` in dataclasses.

  Close #2581

* Changed description of W0199 to use the term 2-item-tuple instead of 2-uple.

* Allow a ``.`` as a prefix for Sphinx name resolution.

* Checkers must now keep a 1 to 1 relationship between "msgid" (ie: C1234) and "symbol" (ie : human-readable-symbol)
* In checkers, an old_names can now be used for multiple new messages and pylint is now a little faster

Caused by #1164. It means if you do a partial old_names for a message definition an exception will tell you that you
must rename the associated identification.

* Allow the choice of f-strings as a valid way of formatting logging strings.

  Closes #2395

* Added ``--list-msgs-enabled`` command to list all enabled and disabled messages given the current RC file and command line arguments.


What's New in Pylint 2.3.0?
===========================
Release date: 2019-02-27

* Protect against ``NonDeducibleTypeHierarchy`` when calling semi-private ``is_subtype``

  ``astroid.helpers.is_subtype`` raises ``NonDeducibleTypeHierarchy`` when it cannot infer
  the base classes of the given types, but that makes sense in its context given that
  the method is mostly used to inform the inference process about the hierarchy of classes.
  Doesn't make that much sense for ``pylint`` itself, which is why we're handling the
  exception here, rather than in ``astroid``

  Close PyCQA/astroid#644

* Added a new command line option ``list-groups`` for listing all the check groups ``pylint`` knows about.

* Allow ``BaseException`` for emitting ``broad-except``, just like ``Exception``.

  Close #2741

* Fixed a crash that occurred for ``bad-str-strip-call`` when ``strip()`` received ``None``

  Close #2743

* Don't emit ``*-not-iterating`` checks for builtins consumed by ``itertools``

  Close #2731

* Fix a crash caused by iterating over ``Uninferable`` in a string formatting check.

  Close #2727

* Fixed false positives for ``no-self-argument`` and ``unsubscriptable-object`` when using ``__class_getitem__`` (new in Python 3.7)

  Close #2416

* Support ``Ellipsis`` as a synonym for ``pass`` statements.

  Close #2718

* ``fixme`` gets triggered only on comments.

  Close #2321

* Fixed a false positive for ``unused-variable`` and ``nonlocal`` assignments

  Close #2671

* Added ``load_configuration()`` hook for plugins

  New optional hook for plugins is added: ``load_configuration()``.
  This hook is executed after configuration is loaded to prevent
  overwriting plugin specific configuration via user-based
  configuration.

  Close #2635

* Fix missing-raises-doc false positive (W9006)

  Close #1502

* Exempt starred unpacking from ``*-not-iterating`` Python 3 checks

  Close #2651

* Make ``compare-to-zero`` less zealous by checking against equality and identity

  Close #2645

* Add ``no-else-raise`` warning (R1720)

  Close #2558

* Exempt ``yield from`` from ``*-not-iterating`` Python 3 checks.

  Close #2643

* Fix incorrect generation of ``no-else-return`` warnings (R1705)

  Fixed issue where ``if`` statements with nested ``if`` statements
  were incorrectly being flagged as ``no-else-return`` in some cases and
  not being flagged as ``no-else-return`` in other cases.  Added tests
  for verification and updated pylint source files to eliminate newly
  exposed warnings.

* Fix false positive with ``not-async-context-manager`` caused by not understanding ``contextlib.asynccontextmanager``

  Close #2440

* Refactor ``bad-reversed-sequence`` to account for more objects that can define ``__reversed__``

  One such object would be an enum class, for which ``__reversed__`` yields each individual enum.
  As such, the check for ``bad-reversed-sequence`` needs to not differentiate between classes
  and instances when it comes for checking of ``__reversed__`` presence.

  Close #2598

* Added ``wrong-exception-operation``

  Used when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation
  is not valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having
  binary operations between exceptions in except handlers.

  Close #2494

* ``no-member`` is emitted for enums when they lack a member

  Previously we weren't doing this because we detected a
  ``__getattr__`` implementation on the ``Enum`` class
  (and this check is skipped for classes with ``__getattr__``),
  but that is fine for Enums, given that they are inferred in a customised
  way in astroid.

  Close #2565

* Generalize ``chained-comparison``

  Previous version incorrectly detects `a < b < c and b < d` and fails to
  detect `a < b < c and c < d`.

* Avoid popping __main__ when using multiple jobs

  Close #2689

* Add a new option 'check-str-concat-over-line-jumps' to check 'implicit-str-concat-in-sequence'

* Fixes for the new style logging format linter.

  The number of arguments was not handled properly, leading to an always
  successful check.

* Fix false positive ``not-callable`` for uninferable properties.

* Fix false positive ``useless-else-on-loop`` if the break is deep in the else
  of an inner loop.

* Minor improvements to the help text for a few options.


What's New in Pylint 2.2.2?
===========================
Release date: 2018-11-28

* Change the ``logging-format-style`` to use name identifier instead of their
  corresponding Python identifiers

  This is to prevent users having to think about escaping the default value for
  ``logging-format-style`` in the generated config file. Also our config parsing
  utilities don't quite support escaped values when it comes to ``choices`` detection,
  so this would have needed various hacks around that.

  Closes #2614


What's New in Pylint 2.2.1?
===========================
Release date: 2018-11-27

* Fix a crash caused by ``implicit-str-concat-in-sequence`` and multi-bytes characters.

  Closes #2610


What's New in Pylint 2.2?
=========================

Release date: 2018-11-25

   * Consider ``range()`` objects for ``undefined-loop-variable`` leaking from iteration.

     Close #2533

   * ``deprecated-method`` can use the attribute name for identifying a deprecated method

     Previously we were using the fully qualified name, which we still do, but the fully
     qualified name for some ``unittest`` deprecated aliases leads to a generic
     deprecation function. Instead on relying on that, we now also rely on the attribute
     name, which should solve some false positives.

     Close #1653
     Close #1946

   * Fix compatibility with changes to stdlib tokenizer.

   * ``pylint`` is less eager to consume the whole line for pragmas

     Close #2485

   * Obtain the correct number of CPUs for virtualized or containerized environments.

     Close #2519

   * Change ``unbalanced-tuple-unpacking`` back to a warning.

     It used to be a warning until a couple of years ago, after it was promoted to
     an error. But the check might be suggesting the wrong thing in some cases,
     for instance when checking against ``sys.argv`` which cannot be known at static
     analysis time. Given it might rely on potential unknown data, it's best to
     have it as a warning.

     Close #2522

   * Remove ``enumerate`` usage suggestion when defining ``__iter__`` (C0200)

     Close #2477

   * Emit ``too-many-starred-assignment`` only when the number of Starred nodes is per assignment elements

     Close #2513

   * ``try-except-raise`` checker now handles multilevel inheritance hirerachy for exceptions correctly.

     Close #2484

   * Add a new check, ``simplifiable-if-expression`` for expressions like ``True if cond else False``.

     Close #2487

   * ``too-few-public-methods`` is not reported for ``typing.NamedTuple``

     Close #2459

   * ```too-few-public-methods`` is not reported for dataclasses created with options.

     Close #2488

   * Remove wrong modules from 'bad-python3-import'.

     Close #2453

   * The ``json`` reporter prints an empty list when no messages are emitted

     Close #2446

   * Add a new check, ``duplicate-string-formatting-argument``

     This new check is emitted whenever a duplicate string formatting argument
     is found.

     Close #497

   * ``assignment-from-no-return`` is not emitted for coroutines.

     Close #1715

   * Report format string type mismatches.

   * ``consider-using-ternary`` and ``simplified-boolean-expression`` no longer emit for sequence based checks

     Close #2473

   * Handle ``AstroidSyntaxError`` when trying to import a module.

     Close #2313

   * Allow ``__module__`` to be redefined at a class level. Close #2451

   * ``pylint`` used to emit an ``unused-variable`` error if unused import was found in the function. Now instead of
     ``unused-variable``, ``unused-import`` is emitted.

     Close #2421

   * Handle asyncio.coroutine when looking for ``not-an-iterable`` check.

     Close #996

   * The ``locally-enabled`` check is gone.

     Close #2442

   * Infer decorated methods when looking for method-hidden

     Close #2369

   * Pick the latest value from the inferred values when looking for ``raising-non-exception``

     Close #2431

   * Extend the TYPE_CHECKING guard to TYPE_CHECKING name as well, not just the attribute

     Close #2411

   * Ignore import x.y.z as z cases for checker ``useless-import-alias``.

     Close #2309

   * Fix false positive ``undefined-variable`` and ``used-before-assignment`` with nonlocal keyword usage.

     Close #2049

   * Stop ``protected-access`` exception for missing class attributes

   * Don't emit ``assignment-from-no-return`` for decorated function nodes

     Close #2385

   * ``unnecessary-pass`` is now also emitted when a function or class contains only docstring and pass statement.

      In Python, stubbed functions often have a body that contains just a single ``pass`` statement,
      indicating that the function doesn't do anything. However, a stubbed function can also have just a
      docstring, and function with a docstring and no body also does nothing.

      Close #2208

   * ``duplicate-argument-name`` is emitted for more than one duplicate argument per function

      Close #1712

   * Allow double indentation levels for more distinguishable indentations

     Close #741

   * Consider tuples in exception handler for ``try-except-raise``.
     Close #2389

   * Fix astroid.ClassDef check in checkers.utils.is_subclass_of

   * Fix wildcard imports being ignored by the import checker

   * Fix external/internal distinction being broken in the import graph

   * Fix wildcard import check not skipping ``__init__.py``

     Close #2430

   * Add new option to logging checker, ``logging_format_style``

   * Fix --ignore-imports to understand multi-line imports

     Close #1422
     Close #2019

   * Add a new check 'implicit-str-concat-in-sequence' to spot string concatenation inside lists, sets & tuples.

   * ``literal-comparison`` is now emitted for 0 and 1 literals.


What's New in Pylint 2.1.1?
===========================
Release date: 2018-08-07

   * fix pylint crash due to ``misplaced-format-function`` not correctly handling class attribute.
     Close #2384

   * Do not emit \*-builtin for Python 3 builtin checks when the builtin is used inside a try-except

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2228

   * ``simplifiable-if-statement`` not emitted when dealing with subscripts


What's New in Pylint 2.1?
=========================

Release date: 2018-08-01
   * ``trailing-comma-tuple`` gets emitted for ``yield`` statements as well.

      Close #2363

   * Get only the arguments of the scope function for ``redefined-argument-from-local``

     Close #2364

   * Add a check ``misplaced-format-function`` which is emitted if format function is used on
     non str object.

     Close #2200

   * ``chain.from_iterable`` no longer emits `dict-{}-not-iterating` when dealing with dict values and keys

   * Demote the ``try-except-raise`` message from an error to a warning (E0705 -> W0706)

      Close #2323

   * Correctly handle the new name of the Python implementation of the ``abc`` module.

     Close PyCQA/astroid#2288

    * Modules with ``__getattr__`` are exempted by default from ``no-member``

      There's no easy way to figure out if a module has a particular member when
      the said module uses ``__getattr__``, which is a new addition to Python 3.7.
      Instead we assume the safe thing to do, in the same way we do for classes,
      and skip those modules from checking.

      Close #2331

    * Fix a false positive ``invalid name`` message when method or attribute name is longer then 30 characters.

      Close #2047

    * Include the type of the next branch in ``no-else-return``

      Close #2295

    * Fix inconsistent behaviour for bad-continuation on first line of file

      Close #2281

     * Fix not being able to disable certain messages on the last line through
       the global disable option

       Close #2278

    * Don't emit ``useless-return`` when we have a single statement that is the return itself

      We still want to be explicit when a function is supposed to return
      an optional value; even though ``pass`` could still work, it's not explicit
      enough and the function might look like it's missing an implementation.
      Close #2300

   * Fix false-positive undefined-variable for self referential class name in lamdbas

      Close #704

    * Don't crash when ``pylint`` is unable to infer the value of an argument to ``next()``

      Close #2316

    * Don't emit ``not-an-iterable`` when dealing with async iterators.

      But do emit it when using the usual iteration protocol against
      async iterators.

      Close #2311

   * Can specify a default docstring type for when the check cannot guess the type

      Close #1169


What's New in Pylint 2.0?
=========================

Release date: 2018-07-15
    * ``try-except-raise`` should not be emitted if there are any parent exception class handlers.

       Close #2284

    * ``trailing-comma-tuple`` can be emitted for ``return`` statements as well.

       Close #2269

    * Fix a false positive ``inconsistent-return-statements`` message when exception is raised
      inside an else statement.

      Close #1782

    * ``ImportFrom`` nodes correctly use the full name for the import sorting checks.

      Close #2181

    * [].extend and similar builtin operations don't emit `dict-*-not-iterating` with the Python 3 porting checker

      Close #2187

    * Add a check ``consider-using-dict-comprehension`` which is emitted if for dict initialization
      the old style with list comprehensions is used.

    * Add a check ``consider-using-set-comprehension`` which is emitted if for set initialization
      the old style with list comprehensions is used.

    * ``logging-not-lazy`` is emitted whenever pylint infers that a string is built with addition

      Close #2193

    * Add a check ``chained-comparison`` which is emitted if a boolean operation can be simplified
      by chaining some of its operations.
      e.g "a < b and b < c", can be simplified as "a < b < c".

      Close #2032

    * Add a check ``consider-using-in`` for comparisons of a variable against
      multiple values with "==" and "or"s instead of checking if the variable
      is contained "in" a tuple of those values.

    * ``in`` is considered iterating context for some of the Python 3 porting checkers

      Close #2186

    * Add ``--ignore-none`` flag to control if pylint should warn about ``no-member`` where the owner is None

    * Fix a false positive related to ``too-many-arguments`` and bounded ``__get__`` methods

      Close #2172

    * ``mcs`` as the first parameter of metaclass's ``__new__`` method was replaced by ``cls``

      Close #2028

    * ``assignment-from-no-return`` considers methods as well.

       Close #2081

    * Support typing.TYPE_CHECKING for *unused-import* errors

      Close #1948

    * Inferred classes at a function level no longer emit ``invalid-name``
      when they don't respect the variable regular expression

      Close #1049

    * Added basic support for postponed evaluation of function annotations.

      Close #2069

    * Fix a bug with ``missing-kwoa`` and variadics parameters

      Close #1111

    * ``simplifiable-if-statement`` takes in account only when assigning to same targets

       Close #1984

    * Make ``len-as-condition`` test more cases, such as ``len() < 1`` or ``len <= 0``

    * Fix false-positive ``line-too-long`` message emission for
      commented line at the end of a module

      Close #1950

    * Fix false-positive ``bad-continuation`` for with statements

      Close #461

    * Don't warn about ``stop-iteration-return`` when using ``next()`` over ``itertools.count``

      Close #2158

    * Add a check ``consider-using-get`` for unidiomatic usage of value/default-retrieval
      for a key from a dictionary

      Close #2076

    * invalid-slice-index is not emitted when the slice is used as index for a complex object.

      We only use a handful of known objects (list, set and friends) to figure out if
      we should emit invalid-slice-index when the slice is used to subscript an object.

    * Don't emit ``unused-import`` anymore for typing imports used in type comments.

    * Add a new check 'useless-import-alias'.

      Close #2052

    * Add ``comparison-with-callable`` to warn for comparison with bare callable, without calling it.

      Close #2082

    * Don't warn for ``missing-type-doc`` and/or ``missing-return-type-doc``, if type
      annotations exist on the function signature for a parameter and/or return type.
      Close #2083

    * Add ``--exit-zero`` option for continuous integration scripts to more
      easily call Pylint in environments that abort when a program returns a
      non-zero (error) status code.

      Close #2042

    * Warn if the first argument of an instance/ class method gets assigned

      Close #977

    * New check ``comparison-with-itself`` to check comparison between same value.

      Close #2051

    * Add a new warning, 'logging-fstring-interpolation', emitted when f-string
      is used within logging function calls.

      Close #1998

    * Don't show 'useless-super-delegation' if the subclass method has different type annotations.

      Close #1923

    * Add ``unhashable-dict-key`` check.

      Closes #586

    * Don't warn that a global variable is unused if it is defined by an import

      Close #1453

    * Skip wildcard import check for ``__init__.py``.

      Close #2026

    * The Python 3 porting mode can now run with Python 3 as well.

    * ``too-few-public-methods`` is not emitted for dataclasses.

       Close #1793

    * New verbose mode option, enabled with ``--verbose`` command line flag, to
      display of extra non-checker-related output. It is disabled by default.

      Close #1863

    * ``undefined-loop-variable`` takes in consideration non-empty iterred objects before emitting

      Close #2039

    * Add support for numpydoc optional return value names.

      Close #2030

    * ``singleton-comparison`` accounts for negative checks

      Close #2037

    * Add a check ``consider-using-in`` for comparisons of a variable against
      multiple values with "==" and "or"s instead of checking if the variable
      is contained "in" a tuple of those values.

      Close #1977

    * defaultdict and subclasses of dict are now handled for dict-iter-* checks

      Close #2005

    * ``logging-format-interpolation`` also emits when f-strings are used instead of % syntax.

      Close #1788

    * Don't trigger misplaced-bare-raise when the raise is in a finally clause

      Close #1924

    * Add a new check, ``possibly-unused-variable``.

      This is similar to ``unused-variable``, the only difference is that it is
      emitted when we detect a locals() call in the scope of the unused variable.
      The ``locals()`` call could potentially use the said variable, by consuming
      all values that are present up to the point of the call. This new check
      allows to disable this error when the user intentionally uses ``locals()``
      to consume everything.

      Close #1909.

    * ``no-else-return`` accounts for multiple cases

       The check was a bit overrestrictive because we were checking for
       return nodes in the .orelse node. At that point though the if statement
       can be refactored to not have the orelse. This improves the detection of
       other cases, for instance it now detects TryExcept nodes that are part of
       the .else branch.

       Close #1852

    * Added two new checks, ``invalid-envvar-value`` and ``invalid-envvar-default``.

      The former is trigger whenever pylint detects that environment variable manipulation
      functions uses a different type than strings, while the latter is emitted whenever
      the said functions are using a default variable of different type than expected.

    * Add a check ``consider-using-join`` for concatenation of strings using str.join(sequence)

      Close #1952

    * Add a check ``consider-swap-variables`` for swapping variables with tuple unpacking

      Close #1922

    * Add new checker ``try-except-raise`` that warns the user if an except handler block
      has a ``raise`` statement as its first operator. The warning is shown when there is
      a bare raise statement, effectively re-raising the exception that was caught or the
      type of the exception being raised is the same as the one being handled.

    * Don't crash on invalid strings when checking for ``logging-format-interpolation``

      Close #1944

    * Exempt ``__doc__`` from triggering a ``redefined-builtin``

      ``__doc__`` can be used to specify a docstring for a module without
      passing it as a first-statement string.

    * Fix false positive bad-whitespace from function arguments with default
      values and annotations

    * Fix error when checking if function is exception, as in ``bad-exception-context``.

    * Fix false positive ``inconsistent-return-statements`` message when a
      function is defined under an if statement.

      Close #1794

    * New ``useless-return`` message when function or method ends with a "return" or
      "return None" statement and this is the only return statement in the body.

    * Fix false positive ``inconsistent-return-statements`` message by
      avoiding useless exception inference if the exception is not handled.

      For this to work we had to make multiple messages with the same old name
      possible.

      Closes #1164


What's New in Pylint 1.9?
=========================

Release date: 2018-05-15

    * Added two new Python 3 porting checks, ``exception-escape`` and ``comprehension-escape``

      These two are emitted whenever pylint detects that a variable defined in the
      said blocks is used outside of the given block. On Python 3 these values are deleted.

    * Added a new ``deprecated-sys-function``, emitted when accessing removed sys members.

    * Added ``xreadlines-attribute``, emitted when the ``xreadlines()`` attribute is accessed.

    * The Python 3 porting mode can now run with Python 3 as well.

    * docparams extension allows abstract methods to document what overriding
      implementations should return, and to raise NotImplementedError without
      documenting it.

      Closes #2044

    * Special methods do not count towards ``too-few-methods``,
      and are considered part of the public API.

    * Enum classes do not trigger ``too-few-methods``

      Close #605

    * Added a new Python 2/3 check for accessing ``operator.div``, which is removed in Python 3

      Close #1936

    * Added a new Python 2/3 check for accessing removed urllib functions

      Close #1997


What's New in Pylint 1.8.1?
===========================
Release date: 2017-12-15

    * Wrong version number in __pkginfo__.


What's New in Pylint 1.8?
=========================

Release date: 2017-12-15

    * Respect disable=... in config file when running with --py3k.

    * New warning ``shallow-copy-environ`` added

      Shallow copy of os.environ doesn't work as people may expect. os.environ
      is not a dict object but rather a proxy object, so any changes made
      on copy may have unexpected effects on os.environ

      Instead of copy.copy(os.environ) method os.environ.copy() should be
      used.

      See https://bugs.python.org/issue15373 for details.

      Close #1301

    * Do not display no-absolute-import warning multiple times per file.

    * ``trailing-comma-tuple`` refactor check now extends to assignment with
       more than one element (such as lists)

      Close #1713

    * Fixing u'' string in superfluous-parens message

      Close #1420

    * ``abstract-class-instantiated`` is now emitted for all inference paths.

       Close #1673

    * Add set of predefined naming style to ease configuration of checking
      naming conventions.

      Closes #1013

    * Added a new check, ``keyword-arg-before-vararg``

      This is emitted for function definitions
      in which keyword arguments are placed before variable
      positional arguments (\*args).

      This may lead to args list getting modified if keyword argument's value
      is not provided in the function call assuming it will take default value
      provided in the definition.

    * The ``invalid-name`` check contains the name of the template that caused the failure

      Close #1176

    * Using the -j flag won't start more child linters than needed.

      Contributed by Roman Ivanov in #1614

    * Fix a false positive with bad-python3-import on relative imports

      Close #1608

    * Added a new Python 3 check, ``non-ascii-bytes-literals``

      Close #1545

    * Added a couple of new Python 3 checks for accessing dict methods in non-iterable context

    * Protocol checks (not-a-mapping, not-an-iterable and co.) aren't emitted on classes with dynamic getattr

    * Added a new warning, 'bad-thread-instantiation'

      This message is emitted when the threading.Thread class does not
      receive the target argument, but receives just one argument, which
      is by default the group parameter.

      Close #1327

    * In non-quiet mode, absolute path of used config file is logged to
      standard error.
      Close #1519

    * Raise meaningful exception for invalid reporter class being selected

      When unknown reporter class will be selected as Pylint reporter,
      meaningful error message would be raised instead of bare ``ImportError``
      or ``AttribueError`` related to module or reporter class being not found.
      Close #1388

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing removed functions from itertools
      like ``izip`` or ``ifilterfalse``

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing removed fields from the types
      module like ``UnicodeType`` or ``XRangeType``

    * Added a new Python 3 check for declaring a method ``next`` that would have
      been treated as an iterator in Python 2 but a normal function in Python 3.

    * Added a new key-value pair in json output. The key is ``message-id``
      and the value is the message id.
      Close #1512

    * Added a new Python 3.0 check for raising a StopIteration inside a generator.
      The check about raising a StopIteration inside a generator is also valid if the exception
      raised inherit from StopIteration.
      Close #1385

    * Added a new warning, ``raising-format-tuple``, to detect multi-argument
      exception construction instead of message string formatting.

    * Added a new check for method of logging module that concatenate string via + operator
      Close #1479

    * Added parameter for limiting number of suggestions in spellchecking checkers

    * Fix a corner-case in ``consider-using-ternary`` checker.

      When object ``A`` used in  ``X and A or B`` was falsy in boolean context,
      Pylint incorrectly emitted non-equivalent ternary-based suggestion.
      After a change message is correctly not emitted for this case.
      Close #1559

    * Added ``suggestion-mode`` configuration flag. When flag is enabled, informational
      message is emitted instead of cryptic error message for attributes accessed on
      c-extensions.
      Close #1466

    * Fix a false positive ``useless-super-delegation`` message when
      parameters default values are different from those used in the base class.
      Close #1085

    * Disabling 'wrong-import-order', 'wrong-import-position', or
      'ungrouped-imports' for a single line now prevents that line from
      triggering violations on subsequent lines.

      Close #1336

    * Added a new Python check for inconsistent return statements inside method or function.
      Close #1267

    * Fix ``superfluous-parens`` false positive related to handling logical statements
      involving ``in`` operator.

      Close #574

    * ``function-redefined`` message is no longer emitted for functions and
      methods which names matches dummy variable name regular expression.
      Close #1369

    * Fix ``missing-param-doc`` and ``missing-type-doc`` false positives when
      mixing ``Args`` and ``Keyword Args`` in Google docstring.
      Close #1409

     * Fix ``missing-docstring`` false negatives when modules, classes, or methods
       consist of compound statements that exceed the ``docstring-min-length``

    * Fix ``useless-else-on-loop`` false positives when break statements are
      deeply nested inside loop.
      Close #1661

    * Fix no ``wrong-import-order`` message emitted on ordering of first and third party
      libraries. With this fix, pylint distinguishes third and first party
      modules when checking import order.
      Close #1702

    * Fix ``pylint disable=fixme`` directives ignored for comments following the
      last statement in a file.
      Close #1681

    * Fix ``line-too-long`` message deactivated by wrong disable directive.
      The directive ``disable=fixme`` doesn't deactivate anymore the emission
      of ``line-too-long`` message for long commented lines.
      Close #1741

    * If the rcfile specified on the command line doesn't exist, then an
      IOError exception is raised.
      Close #1747

    * Fix the wrong scope of the ``disable=`` directive after a commented line.
      For example when a ``disable=line-too-long`` directive is at the end of
      a long commented line, it no longer disables the emission of ``line-too-long``
      message for lines that follow.
      Close #1742


What's New in Pylint 1.7.1?
===========================
Release date: 2017-04-17

    * Fix a false positive which occurred when an exception was reraised

      Close #1419

    * Fix a false positive of ``disallow-trailing-tuple``

      The check was improved by verifying for non-terminating newlines, which
      should exempt function calls and function definitions from the check
      Close #1424


What's New in Pylint 1.7?
=========================

Release date: 2017-04-13

    * Don't emit missing-final-newline or trailing-whitespace for formfeeds (page breaks).

      Close #1218 and #1219

    * Don't emit by default no-member if we have opaque inference objects in the inference results

      This is controlled through the new flag ignore-on-opaque-inference, which is by
      default True. The inference can return  multiple potential results while
      evaluating a Python object, but some branches might not be evaluated, which
      results in partial inference. In that case, it might be useful to still emit
      no-member and other checks for the rest of the inferred objects.

    * Added new message ``assign-to-new-keyword`` to warn about assigning to names which
      will become a keyword in future Python releases.

      Close #1351

    * Split the 'missing or differing' in parameter documentation in different error.
      'differing-param-doc' covers the differing part of the old 'missing-param-doc',
      and 'differing-type-doc' covers the differing part of the old 'missing-type-doc'

      Close #1342

    * Added a new error, 'used-prior-global-declaration', which is emitted when a name
      is used prior a global declaration in a function. This causes a SyntaxError in
      Python 3.6

      Close #1257

    * The protocol checks are emitting their messages when a special method is set to None.

      Close #1263

    * Properly detect if imported name is assigned to same name in different
      scope.

      Close #636, #848, #851, and #900

    * Require one space for annotations with type hints, as per PEP 8.

    * 'trailing-comma-tuple' check was added

      This message is emitted when pylint finds an one-element tuple,
      created by a stray comma. This can suggest a potential problem in the
      code and it is recommended to use parantheses in order to emphasise the
      creation of a tuple, rather than relying on the comma itself.

    * Don't emit not-callable for instances with unknown bases.

      Close #1213

    * Treat keyword only arguments the same as positional arguments with regard to unused-argument check

    * Don't try to access variables defined in a separate scope when checking for ``protected-access``

    * Added new check to detect incorrect usage of len(SEQUENCE) inside
      test conditions.

    * Added new extension to detect comparisons against empty string constants

    * Added new extension to detect comparisons of integers against zero

    * Added new error conditions for 'bad-super-call'

      Now detects ``super(type(self), self)`` and ``super(self.__class__, self)``
      which can lead to recursion loop in derived classes.

    * PyLinter.should_analyze_file has a new optional parameter, called ``is_argument``

      Close #1079

    * Add attribute hints for missing members

      Closes #1035

    * Add a new warning, 'redefined-argument-from-local'

      Closes #649

    * Support inline comments for comma separated values in the config file

      Closes #1024

    * epylint.py_run's *script* parameter was removed.

    * epylint.py_run now uses ``shell=False`` for running the underlying process.

      Closes #441

    * Added a new warning, 'useless-super-delegation'

      Close 839.

    * Added a new error, 'invalid-metaclass', raised when
      we can detect that a class is using an improper metaclass.

      Close #579

    * Added a new refactoring message, 'literal-comparison'.

      Close #786

    * arguments-differ takes in consideration kwonlyargs and variadics

      Close #983

    * Removed --optimized-ast. Part of #975.

    * Removed --files-output option. Part of #975.

    * Removed pylint-gui from the package.

    * Removed the HTML reporter. Part of #975.

    * ignored-argument-names is now used for ignoring arguments for unused-variable check.

      This option was used for ignoring arguments when computing the correct number of arguments
      a function should have, but for handling the arguments with regard
      to unused-variable check, dummy-variables-rgx was used instead. Now, ignored-argument-names
      is used for its original purpose and also for ignoring the matched arguments for
      the unused-variable check. This offers a better control of what should be ignored
      and how.
      Also, the same option was moved from the design checker to the variables checker,
      which means that the option now appears under the ``[VARIABLES]`` section inside
      the configuration file.
      Close #862.

    * Fix a false positive for keyword variadics with regard to keyword only arguments.

      If a keyword only argument was necessary for a function, but that function was called
      with keyword variadics (\**kwargs), then we were emitting a missing-kwoa false positive,
      which is now fixed.

      Close #934.

    * Fix some false positives with unknown sized variadics.

      Close #878

    * Added a new extension, check_docstring, for checking PEP 257 conventions.

      Closes #868.

    * config files with BOM markers can now be read.

      Close #864.

    * epylint.py_run does not crash on big files, using .communicate() instead of .wait()

      Close #599

    * Disable reports by default and show the evaluation score by default

      As per discussion from issue #746, the reports were disabled by
      default in order to simplify the interaction between the tool
      and the users. The score is still shown by default, as a way of
      closely measuring when it increases or decreases due to changes
      brought to the code.

    * Disable the information category messages by default.

      This is a step towards making pylint more sane, as
      per the discussion from issue #746.

    * Catch more cases as not proper iterables for __slots__ with
      regard to invalid-slots pattern. Closes issue #775.

    * empty indent strings are rejected.

    * Added a new error, 'relative-beyond-top-level', which is emitted
      when a relative import was attempted beyond the top level package.

      Closes issue #588.

    * Added a new warning, 'unsupported-assignment-operation', which is
      emitted when item assignment is tried on an object which doesn't
      have this ability. Closes issue #591.

    * Added a new warning, 'unsupported-delete-operation', which is
      emitted when item deletion is tried on an object which doesn't
      have this ability. Closes issue #592.

    * Fix a false positive of 'redundant-returns-doc', occurred when the documented
      function was using *yield* instead of *return*.

      Closes issue #984.

    * Fix false positives of 'missing-[raises|params|type]-doc' due to not
      recognizing keyword synonyms supported by Sphinx.

    * Added a new refactoring message, 'consider-merging-isinstance', which is
      emitted whenever we can detect that consecutive isinstance calls can be
      merged together.

      Closes issue #968

    * Fix a false positive of 'missing-param-doc' and 'missing-type-doc',
      occurred when a class docstring uses the 'For the parameters, see'
      magic string but the class __init__ docstring does not, or vice versa.

    * ``redefined-outer-name`` is now also emitted when a nested loop's target
      variable is the same as a target variable in an outer loop.

      Closes issue #911.

    * Added proper exception type inference for 'missing-raises-doc'.

    * Added InvalidMessageError exception class to replace asserts in
      pylint.utils.

    * More thorough validation in MessagesStore.register_messages() to avoid
      one message accidentally overwriting another.

    * InvalidMessageError, UnknownMessage, and EmptyReport exceptions are
      moved to the new pylint.exceptions submodule.

    * UnknownMessage and EmptyReport are renamed to UnknownMessageError and
      EmptyReportError.

    * Warnings 'missing-returns-type-doc' and 'missing-yields-type-doc'
      have each been split into two warnings - 'missing-[return|yield]-doc'
      and 'missing-[return|yield]-type-doc'.

    * Added epytext support to docparams extension.

      Closes #1029.

    * Support having plugins with the same name and with options defined

      Closes #1018

    * Sort configuration options in a section

      Closes #1087

    * Added a new Python 3 warning around implementing '__div__', '__idiv__', or
      '__rdiv__' as those methods are phased out in Python 3.

    * Added a new warning, 'overlapping-except', which is
      emitted when two exceptions in the same except-clause are aliases
      for each other or one exceptions is an ancestor of another.

    * Avoid crashing on ill-formatted strings when checking for string formatting errors.

    * Added a new Python 3 warning for calling 'str.encode' or 'str.decode' with a non-text
      encoding.

    * Added new coding convention message, 'single-string-used-for-slots'.

      Closes #1166

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing 'sys.maxint' which was removed in Python 3 in favor
      of 'sys.maxsize'

    * Added a new Python 3 check for bad imports.

    * Added a new Python 3 check for accessing deprecated string functions.

    * Do not warn about unused arguments or function being redefined in singledispatch
      registered implementations.

      Closes #1032 and #1034

    * Added refactoring message 'no-else-return'.

    * Improve unused-variable checker to warn about unused variables in module scope.

      Closes #919

    * Ignore modules import as _ when checking for unused imports.

      Closes #1190

    * Improve handing of Python 3 classes with metaclasses declared in nested scopes.

      Closes #1177

    * Added refactoring message 'consider-using-ternary'.

      Closes #1204

    * Bug-fix for false-positive logging-format-interpolation` when format specifications
      are used in formatted string.

      Fixes #572

    * Added a new switch ``single-line-class-stmt`` to allow single-line declaration
      of empty class bodies.

      Closes #738

    * Protected access in form ``type(self)._attribute`` are now allowed.

      Fixes #1031

    * Let the user modify msg-template when Pylint is called from a Python script

      Fixes #1269

    * Imports checker supports new switch ``allow-wildcard-with-all`` which disables
      warning on wildcard import when imported module defines ``__all__`` variable.

      Fixes #831

    * ``too-many-format-args`` and ``too-few-format-args`` are emitted correctly when
      starred expression are used in RHS tuple.

      Fixes #957

    * ``cyclic-import`` checker supports local disable clauses. When one
      of cycle imports was done in scope where disable clause was active,
      cycle is not reported as violation.

      Fixes #59


What's new in Pylint 1.6.3?
===========================
Release date: 2016-07-18

    * Do not crash when inferring uninferable exception types for docparams extension

      Close #998


What's new in Pylint 1.6.2?
===========================
Release date: 2016-07-15

    * Do not crash when printing the help of options with default regular expressions

      Close #990

    * More granular versions for deprecated modules.

      Close #991


What's new in Pylint 1.6.1?
===========================
Release date: 2016-07-07

    * Use environment markers for supporting conditional dependencies.


What's New in Pylint 1.6.0?
===========================
Release date: 2016-07-03

    * Added a new extension, ``pylint.extensions.mccabe``, for warning
      about complexity in code.

    * Deprecate support for --optimize-ast. Part of #975.

    * Deprecate support for the HTML output. Part of #975.

    * Deprecate support for --output-files. Part of #975.

    * Fixed a documentation error for the check_docs extension. Fixes #735.

    * Made the list of property-defining decorators configurable.

    * Fix a bug where the top name of a qualified import was detected as unused variable.

      Close #923.

    * bad-builtin is now an extension check.

    * generated-members support qualified name through regular expressions.

      For instance, one can specify a regular expression as --generated-members=astroid.node_classes.*
      for ignoring every no-member error that is accessed as in ``astroid.node_classes.missing.object``.

    * Add the ability to ignore files based on regex matching, with the new ``--ignore-patterns``
      option.

      This addresses issue #156 by allowing for multiple ignore patterns
      to be specified. Rather than clobber the existing ignore option, we
      introduced a new one called ignore-patterns.

    * Added a new error, 'trailing-newlines', which is emitted when a file
      has trailing new lines.

      Closes issue #682.

    * Add a new option, 'redefining-builtins-modules', for controlling the modules
      which can redefine builtins, such as six.moves and future.builtins.

      Close #464.

    * 'reimported' is emitted when the same name is imported from different module.

      Close #162.

    * Add a new recommendation checker, 'consider-iterating-dictionary', which is emitted
      which is emitted when a dictionary is iterated through .keys().

      Close #699

    * Use the configparser backport for Python 2

      This fixes a problem we were having with comments inside values, which is fixed
      in Python 3's configparser.
      Close #828

    * A new error was added, 'invalid-length-returned', when the ``__len__``
      special method returned something else than a non-negative number.

      Close issue #557

    * Switch to using isort internally for wrong-import-order.

      Closes #879.

    * check_docs extension can find constructor parameters in __init__.

      Closes #887.

    * Don't warn about invalid-sequence-index if the indexed object has unknown base
      classes.

      Closes #867

    * Don't crash when checking, for super-init-not-called, a method defined in an if block.

    * Do not emit import-error or no-name-in-module for fallback import blocks by default.

      Until now, we warned with these errors when a fallback import block (a TryExcept block
      that contained imports for Python 2 and 3) was found, but this gets cumbersome when
      trying to write compatible code. As such, we don't check these blocks by default,
      but the analysis can be enforced by using the new ``--analyse-fallback-block`` flag.

      Close #769.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.5?
===========================
Release date: 2016-03-21


    * Let visit_importfrom from Python 3 porting checker be called when everything is disabled

      Because the visit method was filtering the patterns it was expecting to be activated,
      it didn't run when everything but one pattern was disabled, leading to spurious false
      positives

      Close #852

    * Don't emit unsubscriptable-value for classes with unknown
      base classes.

      Close #776.

    * Use an OrderedDict for storing the configuration elements

      This fixes an issue related to impredictible order of the disable / enable
      elements from a config file. In certain cases, the disable was coming before
      the enable which resulted in classes of errors to be enabled, even though the intention
      was to disable them. The best example for this was in the context of running multiple
      processes, each one of it having different enables / disables that affected the output.

      Close #815

    * Don't consider bare and broad except handlers as ignoring NameError,
      AttributeError and similar exceptions, in the context of checkers for
      these issues.

      Closes issue #826


What's New in Pylint 1.5.4?
===========================
Release date: 2016-01-15


    * Merge StringMethodChecker with StringFormatChecker. This fixes a
      bug where disabling all the messages and enabling only a handful of
      messages from the StringFormatChecker would have resulted in no
      messages at all.

    * Don't apply unneeded-not over sets.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.3?
===========================
Release date: 2016-01-11

    * Handle the import fallback idiom with regard to wrong-import-order.

      Closes issue #750.

    * Decouple the displaying of reports from the displaying of messages

      Some reporters are aggregating the messages instead of displaying
      them when they are available. The actual displaying was conflatted
      in the generate_reports. Unfortunately this behaviour was flaky
      and in the case of the JSON reporter, the messages weren't shown
      at all if a file had syntax errors or if it was missing.
      In order to fix this, the aggregated messages can now be
      displayed with Reporter.display_message, while the reports are
      displayed with display_reports.

      Closes issues #766 and #765.

    * Ignore function calls with variadic arguments without a context.

      Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments
      will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in
      some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter.
      In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context
      propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected.
      Closes issue #722.

    * Treat AsyncFunctionDef just like FunctionDef nodes,
      by implementing visit_asyncfunctiondef in terms of
      visit_functiondef.

      Closes issue #767.

    * Take in account kwonlyargs when verifying that arguments
      are defined with the check_docs extension.

      Closes issue #745.

    * Suppress reporting 'unneeded-not' inside ``__ne__`` methods

      Closes issue #749.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.2?
===========================
Release date: 2015-12-21

    * Don't crash if graphviz is not installed, instead emit a
      warning letting the user to know.

      Closes issue #168.

    * Accept only functions and methods for the deprecated-method checker.

      This prevents a crash which can occur when an object doesn't have
      .qname() method after the inference.

    * Don't emit super-on-old-class on classes with unknown bases.
      Closes issue #721.

    * Allow statements in ``if`` or ``try`` blocks containing imports.

      Closes issue #714.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.1?
===========================
Release date: 2015-12-02


    * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
      in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.

    * Add wrong-import-position to check_messages's decorator arguments
      for ImportChecker.leave_module
      This fixes an esoteric bug which occurs when ungrouped-imports and
      wrong-import-order are disabled and pylint is executed on multiple files.
      What happens is that without wrong-import-position in check_messages,
      leave_module will never be called, which means that the first non-import node
      from other files might leak into the current file,
      leading to wrong-import-position being emitted by pylint.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered
      in plugin modules. Closes issue #711.

    * Don't emit import-self and cyclic-import for relative imports
      of modules with the same name as the package itself.
      Closes issues #708 and #706.


What's New in Pylint 1.5.0?
===========================
Release date: 2015-11-29


    * Added multiple warnings related to imports. 'wrong-import-order'
      is emitted when PEP 8 recommendations regarding imports are not
      respected (that is, standard imports should be followed by third-party
      imports and then by local imports). 'ungrouped-imports' is emitted
      when imports from the same package or module are not placed
      together, but scattered around in the code. 'wrong-import-position'
      is emitted when code is mixed with imports, being recommended for the
      latter to be at the top of the file, in order to figure out easier by
      a human reader what dependencies a module has.
      Closes issue #692.

    * Added a new refactoring warning, 'unneeded-not', emitted
      when an expression with the not operator could be simplified.
      Closes issue #670.

    * Added a new refactoring warning, 'simplifiable-if-statement',
      used when an if statement could be reduced to a boolean evaluation
      of its test. Closes issue #698.

    * Added a new refactoring warning, 'too-many-boolean-expressions',
      used when an if statement contains too many boolean expressions,
      which makes the code less maintainable and harder to understand.
      Closes issue #677.

    * Property methods are shown as attributes instead of functions in
      pyreverse class diagrams. Closes Issue #284

    * Add a new refactoring error, 'too-many-nested-blocks', which is emitted
      when a function or a method has too many nested blocks, which makes the
      code less readable and harder to understand. Closes issue #668.

    * Add a new error, 'unsubscriptable-object', that is emitted when
      value used in subscription expression doesn't support subscription
      (i.e. doesn't define __getitem__ method).

    * Don't warn about abstract classes instantiated in their own
      body. Closes issue #627.

    * Obsolete options are not present by default in the generated
      configuration file. Closes issue #632.

    * non-iterator-returned can detect classes with iterator-metaclasses.
      Closes issue #679.

    * Add a new error, 'unsupported-membership-test', emitted when value
      to the right of the 'in' operator doesn't support membership test
      protocol (i.e. doesn't define __contains__/__iter__/__getitem__)

    * Add new errors, 'not-an-iterable', emitted when non-iterable value
      is used in an iterating context (starargs, for-statement,
      comprehensions, etc), and 'not-a-mapping', emitted when non-mapping
      value is used in a mapping context. Closes issue #563.

    * Make 'no-self-use' checker not emit a warning if there is a 'super()'
      call inside the method.
      Closes issue #667.

    * Add checker to identify multiple imports on one line.
      Closes issue #598.

    * Fix unused-argument false positive when the "+=" operator is used.
      Closes issue #518.

    * Don't emit import-error for ignored modules. PyLint will not emit import
      errors for any import which is, or is a subpackage of, a module in
      the ignored-modules list. Closes issue #223.

    * Fix unused-import false positive when the import is used in a
      class assignment. Closes issue #475

    * Add a new error, 'not-context-manager', emitted when something
      that doesn't implement __enter__ and __exit__ is used in a with
      statement.

    * Add a new warning, 'confusing-with-statement', emitted by the
      base checker, when an ambiguous looking with statement is used.
      For example `with open() as first, second` which looks like a
      tuple assignment but is actually 2 context managers.

    * Add a new warning, 'duplicate-except', emitted when there is an
      exception handler which handles an exception type that was handled
      before. Closes issue #485.

    * A couple of warnings got promoted to errors, since they could uncover
      potential bugs in the code. These warnings are: assignment-from-none,
      unbalanced-tuple-unpacking, unpacking-non-sequence, non-iterator-returned.
      Closes issue #388.

    * Allow ending a pragma control with a semicolon. In this way, users
      can continue a pragma control with a reason for why it is used,
      as in `# pylint: disable=old-style-class;reason=...`.
      Closes issue #449.

    * --jobs can be used with --load-plugins now. Closes issue #456.

    * Improve the performance of --jobs when dealing only with a package
      name. Closes issue #479.

    * Don't emit an unused-wildcard-import when the imported name comes
      from another module and it is in fact a __future__ name.

    * The colorized reporter now works on Windows. Closes issue #96.

    * Remove pointless-except warning. It was previously disabled by
      default and it wasn't very useful. Closes issue #506.

    * Fix a crash on Python 3 related to the string checker, which
      crashed when it encountered a bytes string with a .format
      method called.

    * Don't warn about no-self-use for builtin properties.

    * Fix a false positive for bad-reversed-sequence, when a subclass
      of a ``dict`` provides a __reversed__ method.

    * Change the default no-docstring-rgx so missing-docstring isn't
      emitted for private functions.

    * Don't emit redefined-outer-name for __future__ directives.
      Closes issue #520.

    * Provide some hints for the bad-builtin message. Closes issue #522.

    * When checking for invalid arguments to a callable, in typecheck.py,
      look up for the __init__ in case the found __new__ comes from builtins.

      Since the __new__ comes from builtins, it will not have attached any
      information regarding what parameters it expects, so the check
      will be useless. Retrieving __init__ in that case will at least
      detect a couple of false negatives. Closes issue #429.

    * Don't emit no-member for classes with unknown bases.

      Since we don't know what those bases might add, we simply ignore
      the error in this case.

    * Lookup in the implicit metaclass when checking for no-member,
      if the class in question has an implicit metaclass, which is
      True for new style classes. Closes issue #438.

    * Add two new warnings, duplicate-bases and inconsistent-mro.

      duplicate-bases is emitted when a class has the same bases
      listed more than once in its bases definition, while inconsistent-mro
      is emitted when no sane mro hierarchy can be determined. Closes issue #526.

    * Remove interface-not-implemented warning. Closes issue #532.

    * Remove the rest of interface checks: interface-is-not-class,
      missing-interface-method, unresolved-interface. The reason is that
      its better to start recommending ABCs instead of the old Zope era
      of interfaces. One side effect of this change is that ignore-iface-methods
      becomes a noop, it's deprecated and it will be removed at some time.

    * Emit a proper deprecation warning for reporters.BaseReporter.add_message.

      The alternative way is to use handle_message. add_message will be removed in
      Pylint 1.6.

    * Added new module 'extensions' for optional checkers with the test
      directory 'test/extensions' and documentation file 'doc/extensions.rst'.

    * Added new checker 'extensions.check_docs' that verifies parameter
      documention in Sphinx, Google, and Numpy style.

    * Detect undefined variable cases, where the "definition" of an undefined
      variable was in del statement. Instead of emitting used-before-assignment,
      which is totally misleading, it now emits undefined-variable.
      Closes issue #528.

    * Don't emit attribute-defined-outside-init and access-member-before-definition
      for mixin classes. Actual errors can occur in mixin classes, but this is
      controlled by the ignore-mixin-members option. Closes issue #412.

    * Improve the detection of undefined variables and variables used before
      assignment for variables used as default arguments to function,
      where the variable was first defined in the class scope.
      Closes issue #342 and issue #404.

    * Add a new warning, 'unexpected-special-method-signature', which is emitted
      when a special method (dunder method) doesn't have the expected signature,
      which can lead to actual errors in the application code.
      Closes issue #253.

    * Remove 'bad-context-manager' due to the inclusion of 'unexpected-special-method-signature'.

    * Don't emit no-name-in-module if the import is guarded by an ImportError, Exception or
      a bare except clause.

    * Don't emit no-member if the attribute access node is protected by an
      except handler, which handles AttributeError, Exception or it is a
      bare except.

    * Don't emit import-error if the import is guarded by an ImportError, Exception or a
      bare except clause.

    * Don't emit undefined-variable if the node is guarded by a NameError, Exception
      or bare except clause.

    * Add a new warning, 'using-constant-test', which is emitted when a conditional
      statement (If, IfExp) uses a test which is always constant, such as numbers,
      classes, functions etc. This is most likely an error from the user's part.
      Closes issue #524.

    * Don't emit 'raising-non-exception' when the exception has unknown
      bases. We don't know what those bases actually are and it's better
      to assume that the user knows what he is doing rather than emitting
      a message which can be considered a false positive.

    * Look for a .pylintrc configuration file in the current folder,
      if pylintrc is not found. Dotted pylintrc files will not be searched
      in the parents of the current folder, as it is done for pylintrc.

    * Add a new error, 'invalid-unary-type-operand', emitted when
      an unary operand is used on something which doesn't support that
      operation (for instance, using the unary bitwise inversion operator
      on an instance which doesn't implement __invert__).

    * Take in consideration differences between arguments of various
      type of functions (classmethods, staticmethods, properties)
      when checking for ``arguments-differ``. Closes issue #548.

    * astroid.inspector was moved to pylint.pyreverse, since it belongs
      there and it doesn't need to be in astroid.

    * astroid.utils.LocalsVisitor was moved to pylint.pyreverse.LocalsVisitor.

    * pylint.checkers.utils.excepts_import_error was removed.
      Use pylint.chekcers.utils.error_of_type instead.

    * Don't emit undefined-all-variables for nodes which can't be
      inferred (YES nodes).

    * yield-outside-func is also emitted for ``yield from``.

    * Add a new error, 'too-many-star-expressions', emitted when
      there are more than one starred expression (`*x`) in an assignment.
      The warning is emitted only on Python 3.

    * Add a new error, 'invalid-star-assignment-target', emitted when
      a starred expression (`*x`) is used as the lhs side of an assignment,
      as in `*x = [1, 2]`. This is not a SyntaxError on Python 3 though.

    * Detect a couple of objects which can't be base classes (bool,
      slice, range and memoryview, which weren't detected until now).

    * Add a new error for the Python 3 porting checker, ``import-star-module-level``,
      which is used when a star import is detected in another scope than the
      module level, which is an error on Python 3. Using this will emit a
      SyntaxWarning on Python 2.

    * Add a new error, 'star-needs-assignment-target', emitted on Python 3 when
      a Starred expression (`*x`) is not used in an assignment target. This is not
      caught when parsing the AST on Python 3, so it needs to be a separate check.

    * Add a new error, 'unsupported-binary-operation', emitted when
      two a binary arithmetic operation is executed between two objects
      which don't support it (a number plus a string for instance).
      This is currently disabled, since the it exhibits way too many false
      positives, but it will be reenabled as soon as possible.

    * New imported features from astroid into pyreverse: pyreverse.inspector.Project,
      pyreverse.inspector.project_from_files and pyreverse.inspector.interfaces.

      These were moved since they didn't belong in astroid.

    * Enable misplaced-future for Python 3. Closes issue #580.

    * Add a new error, 'nonlocal-and-global', which is emitted when a
      name is found to be both nonlocal and global in the same scope.
      Closes issue #581.

    * ignored-classes option can work with qualified names (ignored-classes=optparse.Values)
      Closes issue #297.

    * ignored-modules can work with qualified names as well as with Unix pattern
      matching for recursive ignoring. Closes issues #244.

    * Improve detection of relative imports in non-packages, as well as importing
      missing modules with a relative import from a package.

    * Don't emit no-init if not all the bases from a class are known.
      Closes issue #604.

    * --no-space-check option accepts ``empty-line`` as a possible option.
      Closes issue #541.

    * --generate-rcfile generates by default human readable symbols
      for the --disable option. Closes issue #608.

    * Improved the not-in-loop checker to properly detect more cases.

    * Add a new error, 'continue-in-finally', which is emitted when
      the ``continue`` keyword is found inside a ``finally`` clause, which
      is a SyntaxError.

    * The --zope flag is deprecated and it is slated for removal
      in Pylint 1.6.

      The reason behind this removal is the fact that it's a specialized
      flag and there are solutions for the original problem:
      use --generated-members with the members that causes problems
      when using Zope or add AST transforms tailored to the zope
      project.

      At the same time, --include-ids and --symbols will also be removed
      in Pylint 1.6. Closes issue #570.

    * missing-module-attribute was removed and the corresponding
      CLI option, required-attributes, which is slated for removal
      in Pylint 1.6.

    * missing-reversed-argument was removed.

      The reason behind this is that this kind of errors should be
      detected by the type checker for *all* the builtins and not
      as a special case for the reversed builtin. This will happen
      shortly in the future.

    * --comment flag is obsolete and it will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

    * --profile flag is obsolete and it will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

    * Add a new error, 'misplaced-bare-raise'.

      The error is used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause.
      This can generate a RuntimeError in Python, if there are no active exceptions
      to be reraised. While it works in Python 2 due to the fact that the exception
      leaks outside of the except block, it's nevertheless a behaviour that
      a user shouldn't depend upon, since it's not obvious to the reader of the code
      what exception will be raised and it will not be compatible with Python 3 anyhow.
      Closes issue #633.

    * Bring logilab-common's ureports into pylint.reporters.

      With this change, we moved away from depending on logilab-common,
      having in Pylint all the components that were used from logilab-common.
      The API should be considered an implementation detail and can change at
      some point in the future.
      Closes issue #621.

    * ``reimported`` is emitted for reimported objects on the same line.

      Closes issue #639.

    * Abbreviations of command line options are not supported anymore.

      Using abbreviations for CLI options was never considered to be
      a feature of pylint, this fact being only a side effect of using optparse.
      As this was the case, using --load-plugin or other abbreviation
      for --load-plugins never actually worked, while it also didn't raise
      an error. Closes issue #424.

    * Add a new error, 'nonlocal-without-binding'

      The error is emitted on Python 3 when a nonlocal name is not bound
      to any variable in the parents scopes. Closes issue #582.

    * 'deprecated-module' can be shown for modules which aren't
       available. Closes issue #362.

    * Don't consider a class abstract if its members can't
      be properly inferred.

      This fixes a false positive related to abstract-class-instantiated.
      Closes issue #648.

    * Add a new checker for the async features added by PEP 492.

    * Add a new error, 'yield-inside-async-function', emitted on
      Python 3.5 and upwards when the ``yield`` statement is found inside
      a new coroutine function (PEP 492).

    * Add a new error, 'not-async-context-manager', emitted when
      an async context manager block is used with an object which doesn't
      support this protocol (PEP 492).

    * Add a new convention warning, 'singleton-comparison', emitted when
      comparison to True, False or None is found.

    * Don't emit 'assigning-non-slot' for descriptors. Closes issue #652.

    * Add a new error, 'repeated-keyword', when a keyword argument is passed
      multiple times into a function call.

      This is similar with redundant-keyword-arg, but it's mildly different
      that it needs to be a separate error.

    * --enable=all can now be used. Closes issue #142.

    * Add a new convention message, 'misplaced-comparison-constant',
      emitted when a constant is placed in the left hand side of a comparison,
      as in '5 == func()'. This is also called Yoda condition, since the
      flow of code reminds of the Star Wars green character, conditions usually
      encountered in languages with variabile assignments in conditional
      statements.

    * Add a new convention message, 'consider-using-enumerate', which is
      emitted when code that uses ``range`` and ``len`` for iterating is encountered.
      Closes issue #684.

    * Added two new refactoring messages, 'no-classmethod-decorator' and
      'no-staticmethod-decorator', which are emitted when a static method or a class
      method is declared without using decorators syntax.

      Closes issue #675.



What's New in Pylint 1.4.3?
===========================
Release date: 2015-03-14


    * Remove three warnings: star-args, abstract-class-little-used,
      abstract-class-not-used. These warnings don't add any real value
      and they don't imply errors or problems in the code.

    * Added a new option for controlling the peephole optimizer in astroid.
      The option ``--optimize-ast`` will control the peephole optimizer,
      which is used to optimize a couple of AST subtrees. The current problem
      solved by the peephole optimizer is when multiple joined strings,
      with the addition operator, are encountered. If the numbers of such
      strings is high enough, Pylint will then fail with a maximum recursion
      depth exceeded error, due to its visitor architecture. The peephole
      just transforms such calls, if it can, into the final resulting string
      and this exhibit a problem, because the visit_binop method stops being
      called (in the optimized AST it will be a Const node).


What's New in Pylint 1.4.2?
===========================
Release date: 2015-03-11

    * Don't require a docstring for empty modules. Closes issue #261.

    * Fix a false positive with ``too-few-format-args`` string warning,
      emitted when the string format contained a normal positional
      argument ('{0}'), mixed with a positional argument which did
      an attribute access ('{0.__class__}').
      Closes issue #463.

    * Take in account all the methods from the ancestors
      when checking for too-few-public-methods. Closes issue #471.

    * Catch enchant errors and emit 'invalid-characters-in-docstring'
      when checking for spelling errors. Closes issue #469.

    * Use all the inferred statements for the super-init-not-called
      check. Closes issue #389.

    * Add a new warning, 'unichr-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the unichr builtin is found. Closes issue #472.

    * Add a new warning, 'intern-builtin', emitted by the Python 3
      porting checker, when the intern builtin is found. Closes issue #473.

    * Add support for editable installations.

    * The HTML output accepts the ``--msg-template`` option. Patch by
      Dan Goldsmith.

    * Add 'map-builtin-not-iterating' (replacing 'implicit-map-evaluation'),
      'zip-builtin-not-iterating', 'range-builtin-not-iterating', and
      'filter-builtin-not-iterating' which are emitted by ``--py3k`` when the
      appropriate built-in is not used in an iterating context (semantics
      taken from 2to3).

    * Add a new warning, 'unidiomatic-typecheck', emitted when an explicit
      typecheck uses type() instead of isinstance(). For example,
      `type(x) == Y` instead of `isinstance(x, Y)`. Patch by Chris Rebert.
      Closes issue #299.

    * Add support for combining the Python 3 checker mode with the --jobs
      flag (--py3k and --jobs). Closes issue #467.

    * Add a new warning for the Python 3 porting checker, 'using-cmp-argument',
      emitted when the ``cmp`` argument for the ``list.sort`` or ``sorted builtin``
      is encountered.

    * Make the --py3k flag commutative with the -E flag. Also, this patch
      fixes the leaks of error messages from the Python 3 checker when
      the errors mode was activated. Closes issue #437.


What's New in Pylint 1.4.1?
===========================
Release date: 2015-01-16

    * Look only in the current function's scope for bad-super-call.
      Closes issue #403.

    * Check the return of properties when checking for not-callable.
      Closes issue #406.

    * Warn about using the input() or round() built-ins for Python 3.
      Closes issue #411.

    * Proper abstract method lookup while checking for
      abstract-class-instantiated. Closes issue #401.

    * Use a mro traversal for finding abstract methods. Closes issue #415.

    * Fix a false positive with catching-non-exception and tuples of
      exceptions.

    * Fix a false negative with raising-non-exception, when the raise used
      an uninferrable exception context.

    * Fix a false positive on Python 2 for raising-bad-type, when
      raising tuples in the form 'raise (ZeroDivisionError, None)'.

    * Fix a false positive with invalid-slots-objects, where the slot entry
      was a unicode string on Python 2. Closes issue #421.

    * Add a new warning, 'redundant-unittest-assert', emitted when using
      unittest's methods assertTrue and assertFalse with constant value
      as argument. Patch by Vlad Temian.

    * Add a new JSON reporter, usable through -f flag.

    * Add the method names for the 'signature-differs' and 'argument-differs'
      warnings. Closes issue #433.

    * Don't compile test files when installing.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when using multiple jobs and the files
      given as argument didn't exist at all.


What's New in Pylint 1.4.0?
============================
Release date: 2014-11-23


    * Added new options for controlling the loading of C extensions.
      By default, only C extensions from the stdlib will be loaded
      into the active Python interpreter for inspection, because they
      can run arbitrary code on import. The option
      ``--extension-pkg-whitelist`` can be used to specify modules
      or packages that are safe to load.

    * Change default max-line-length to 100 rather than 80

    * Drop BaseRawChecker class which were only there for backward
      compat for a while now

    * Don't try to analyze string formatting with objects coming from
      function arguments. Closes issue #373.

    * Port source code to be Python 2/3 compatible. This drops the
      need for 2to3, but does drop support for Python 2.5.

    * Each message now comes with a confidence level attached, and
      can be filtered base on this level. This allows to filter out
      all messages that were emitted even though an inference failure
      happened during checking.

    * Improved presenting unused-import message. Closes issue #293.

    * Add new checker for finding spelling errors. New messages:
      wrong-spelling-in-comment, wrong-spelling-in-docstring.
      New options: spelling-dict, spelling-ignore-words.

    * Add new '-j' option for running checks in sub-processes.

    * Added new checks for line endings if they are mixed (LF vs CRLF)
      or if they are not as expected. New messages: mixed-line-endings,
      unexpected-line-ending-format. New option: expected-line-ending-format.

    * 'dangerous-default-value' no longer evaluates the value of the arguments,
      which could result in long error messages or sensitive data being leaked.
      Closes issue #282

    * Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when
      encountering a string which uses only position-based arguments.
      Closes issue #285.

    * Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when using
      keyword argument packing. Closes issue #288.

    * Proper handle class level scope for lambdas.

    * Handle 'too-few-format-args' or 'too-many-format-args' for format
      strings with both named and positional fields. Closes issue #286.

    * Analyze only strings by the string format checker. Closes issue #287.

    * Properly handle nested format string fields. Closes issue #294.

    * Don't emit 'attribute-defined-outside-init' if the attribute
      was set by a function call in a defining method. Closes issue #192.

    * Properly handle unicode format strings for Python 2.
      Closes issue #296.

    * Don't emit 'import-error' if an import was protected by a try-except,
      which excepted ImportError.

    * Fix an 'unused-import' false positive, when the error was emitted
      for all the members imported with 'from import' form.
      Closes issue #304.

    * Don't emit 'invalid-name' when assigning a name in an
      ImportError handler. Closes issue #302.

    * Don't count branches from nested functions.

    * Fix a false positive with 'too-few-format-args', when the format
      strings contains duplicate manual position arguments.
      Closes issue #310.

    * fixme regex handles comments without spaces after the hash.
      Closes issue #311.

    * Don't emit 'unused-import' when a special object is imported
      (__all__, __doc__ etc.). Closes issue #309.

    * Look in the metaclass, if defined, for members not found in the current
      class. Closes issue #306.

    * Don't emit 'protected-access' if the attribute is accessed using
      a property defined at the class level.

    * Detect calls of the parent's __init__, through a binded super() call.

    * Check that a class has an explicitly defined metaclass before
      emitting 'old-style-class' for Python 2.

    * Emit 'catching-non-exception' for non-class nodes. Closes issue #303.

    * Order of reporting is consistent.

    * Add a new warning, 'boolean-datetime', emitted when an instance
      of 'datetime.time' is used in a boolean context. Closes issue #239.

    * Fix a crash which occurred while checking for 'method-hidden',
      when the parent frame was something different than a function.

    * Generate html output for missing files. Closes issue #320.

    * Fix a false positive with 'too-many-format-args', when the format
      string contains mixed attribute access arguments and manual
      fields. Closes issue #322.

    * Extend the cases where 'undefined-variable' and 'used-before-assignment'
      can be detected. Closes issue #291.

    * Add support for customising callback identifiers, by adding a new
      '--callbacks' command line option. Closes issue #326.

    * Add a new warning, 'logging-format-interpolation', emitted when .format()
      string interpolation is used within logging function calls.

    * Don't emit 'unbalanced-tuple-unpacking' when the rhs of the assignment
      is a variable length argument. Closes issue #329.

    * Add a new warning, 'inherit-non-class', emitted when a class inherits
      from something which is not a class. Closes issue #331.

    * Fix another false positives with 'undefined-variable', where the variable
      can be found as a class assignment and used in a function annotation.
      Closes issue #342.

    * Handle assignment of the string format method to a variable.
      Closes issue #351.

    * Support wheel packaging format for PyPi. Closes issue #334.

    * Check that various built-ins that do not exist in Python 3 are not
      used: apply, basestring, buffer, cmp, coerce, execfile, file, long
      raw_input, reduce, StandardError, unicode, reload and xrange.

    * Warn for magic methods which are not used in any way in Python 3:
      __coerce__, __delslice__, __getslice__, __setslice__, __cmp__,
      __oct__, __nonzero__ and __hex__.

    * Don't emit 'assigning-non-slot' when the assignment is for a property.
      Closes issue #359.

    * Fix for regression: '{path}' was no longer accepted in '--msg-template'.

    * Report the percentage of all messages, not just for errors and warnings.
      Closes issue #319.

    * 'too-many-public-methods' is reported only for methods defined in a class,
      not in its ancestors. Closes issue #248.

    * 'too-many-lines' disable pragma can be located on any line, not only the
      first. Closes issue #321.

    * Warn in Python 2 when an import statement is found without a
      corresponding ``from __future__ import absolute_import``.

    * Warn in Python 2 when a non-floor division operation is found without
      a corresponding ``from __future__ import division``.

    * Add a new option, 'exclude-protected', for excluding members
      from the protected-access warning. Closes issue #48.

    * Warn in Python 2 when using dict.iter*(), dict.view*(); none of these
      methods are available in Python 3.

    * Warn in Python 2 when calling an object's next() method; Python 3 uses
      __next__() instead.

    * Warn when assigning to __metaclass__ at a class scope; in Python 3 a
      metaclass is specified as an argument to the 'class' statement.

    * Warn when performing parameter tuple unpacking; it is not supported in
      Python 3.

    * 'abstract-class-instantiated' is also emitted for Python 2.
      It was previously disabled.

    * Add 'long-suffix' error, emitted when encountering the long suffix
      on numbers.

    * Add support for disabling a checker, by specifying an 'enabled'
      attribute on the checker class.

    * Add a new CLI option, --py3k, for enabling Python 3 porting mode. This
      mode will disable all other checkers and will emit warnings and
      errors for constructs which are invalid or removed in Python 3.

    * Add 'old-octal-literal' to Python 3 porting checker, emitted when
      encountering octals with the old syntax.

    * Add 'implicit-map-evaluation' to Python 3 porting checker, emitted
      when encountering the use of map builtin, without explicit evaluation.



What's New in Pylint 1.3.0?

    * Fix some false positives for the cellvar-from-loop warnings.
      Closes issue #233.

    * Return new astroid class nodes when the inferencer can detect that
      that result of a function invocation on a type (like ``type`` or
      `abc.ABCMeta`) is requested. Closes #205.

    * Emit 'undefined-variable' for undefined names when using the
      Python 3 ``metaclass=`` argument.

    * Checkers respect priority now. Close issue #229.

    * Fix a false positive regarding W0511. Closes issue #149.

    * Don't warn with 'bad-format-character' when encountering
      the 'a' format on Python 3.

    * Add multiple checks for PEP 3101 advanced string formatting:
      'bad-format-string', 'missing-format-argument-key',
      'unused-format-string-argument', 'format-combined-specification',
      'missing-format-attribute' and 'invalid-format-index'.

    * Issue broad-except and bare-except even if the number
      of except handlers is different than 1. Fixes issue #113.

    * Issue attribute-defined-outside-init for all cases, not just
      for the last assignment. Closes issue #262.

    * Emit 'not-callable' when calling properties. Closes issue #268.

    * Fix a false positive with unbalanced iterable unpacking,
      when encountering starred nodes. Closes issue #273.

    * Add new checks, 'invalid-slice-index' and 'invalid-sequence-index'
      for invalid sequence and slice indices.

    * Add 'assigning-non-slot' warning, which detects assignments to
      attributes not defined in slots.

    * Don't emit 'no-name-in-module' for ignored modules.
      Closes issue #223.

    * Fix an 'unused-variable' false positive, where the variable is
      assigned through an import. Closes issue #196.

    * Definition order is considered for classes, function arguments
      and annotations. Closes issue #257.

    * Don't emit 'unused-variable' when assigning to a nonlocal.
      Closes issue #275.

    * Do not let ImportError propagate from the import checker, leading to crash
      in some namespace package related cases. Closes issue #203.

    * Don't emit 'pointless-string-statement' for attribute docstrings.
      Closes issue #193.

    * Use the proper mode for pickle when opening and writing the stats file.
      Closes issue #148.

    * Don't emit hidden-method message when the attribute has been
      monkey-patched, you're on your own when you do that.

    * Only emit attribute-defined-outside-init for definition within the same
      module as the offended class, avoiding to mangle the output in some cases.

    * Don't emit 'unnecessary-lambda' if the body of the lambda call contains
      call chaining. Closes issue #243.

    * Don't emit 'missing-docstring' when the actual docstring uses ``.format``.
      Closes issue #281.


What's New in Pylint 1.2.1?
===========================
Release date: 2014-04-30

    * Restore the ability to specify the init-hook option via the
      configuration file, which was accidentally broken in 1.2.0.

    * Add a new warning [bad-continuation] for badly indentend continued
      lines.

    * Emit [assignment-from-none] when the function contains bare returns.

      unpacking-non-sequence to instance attribute unpacking as well.

    * Fix explicit checking of python script (1.2 regression, #219)

    * Restore --init-hook, renamed accidentally into --init-hooks in 1.2.0
      (#211)

    * Add 'indexing-exception' warning, which detects that indexing
      an exception occurs in Python 2 (behaviour removed in Python 3).


What's New in Pylint 1.2.0?
===========================
Release date: 2014-04-18

    * Pass the current python paths to pylint process when invoked via
      epylint.  Fixes BitBucket issue #133.

    * Add -i / --include-ids and -s / --symbols back as completely ignored
      options. Fixes BitBucket issue #180.

    * Extend the number of cases in which logging calls are detected. Fixes
      bitbucket issue #182.

    * Improve pragma handling to not detect pylint:* strings in non-comments.
      Fixes BitBucket issue #79.

    * Do not crash with UnknownMessage if an unknown message ID/name appears
      in disable or enable in the configuration. Patch by Cole Robinson.

    * Add new warning 'eval-used', checking that the builtin function ``eval``
      was used.

    * Make it possible to show a naming hint for invalid name by setting
      include-naming-hint. Also make the naming hints configurable. Fixes
      BitBucket issue #138.

    * Added support for enforcing multiple, but consistent name styles for
      different name types inside a single module; based on a patch written
      by morbo@google.com.

    * Also warn about empty docstrings on overridden methods; contributed
      by sebastianu@google.com.

    * Also inspect arguments to constructor calls, and emit relevant
      warnings; contributed by sebastianu@google.com.

    * Added a new configuration option logging-modules to make the list
      of module names that can be checked for 'logging-not-lazy' et. al.
      configurable; contributed by morbo@google.com.

    * ensure init-hooks is evaluated before other options, notably load-plugins
      (#166)

    * Python 2.5 support restored: fixed small issues preventing pylint to run
      on python 2.5. Bitbucket issues #50 and #62.

    * bitbucket #128: pylint doesn't crash when looking
      for used-before-assignment in context manager
      assignments.

    * Add new warning, 'bad-reversed-sequence', for checking that the
      reversed() builtin receive a sequence (implements __getitem__ and __len__,
      without being a dict or a dict subclass) or an instance which implements
      __reversed__.

    * Mark ``file`` as a bad function when using python2 (closes #8).

      for 'nonlocal' uses.

    * Emit 'undefined-all-variable' if a package's __all__
      variable contains a missing submodule (closes #126).
