README for Pylint (http://www.pylint.org)
=========================================

Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in
Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).

Pylint has many rules enabled by default, way too much to silent them all on a
minimally sized program. It's highly configurable and handle pragmas to control
it from within your code. Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add
your own checks.

It's a free software distributed under the GNU Public Licence.

Development is hosted on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/ .

You can use the python-projects@logilab.org mailing list to discuss about

Install
-------

Pylint requires the astng (the later the better) and logilab-common (version >=
0.53) packages.

*  https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astng
* http://www.logilab.org/projects/common

From the source distribution, extract the tarball and run ::

    python setup.py install

You'll have to install dependencies in a similar way. For debian and
rpm packages, use your usual tools according to your Linux distribution.

More information about installation and available distribution format
may be found in the user manual in the *doc* subdirectory.
