# lint Python modules using external checkers.
# 
# This is the main checker controling the other ones and the reports
# generation. It is itself both a raw checker and an astng checker in order
# to:
# * handle message activation / deactivation at the module level
# * handle some basic but necessary stats'data (number of classes, methods...)
# 
# This checker also defines the following reports:
# * R0001: Total errors / warnings
# * R0002: % errors / warnings by module
# * R0003: Messages
# * R0004: Global evaluation
