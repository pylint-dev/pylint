    stdlib or pylint's own modules.
    CPython issue: https://bugs.python.org/issue33053

    - Remove the first entry. This will always be either "" or the working directory
    - Remove the working directory from the second and third entries
      if PYTHONPATH includes a ":" at the beginning or the end.

      Don't remove it if PYTHONPATH contains the cwd or '.' as the entry will
      only be added once.
    - Don't remove the working directory from the rest. It will be included
      if pylint is installed in an editable configuration (as the last item).
